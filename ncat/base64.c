 * If you have received a written Nmap license agreement or contract

 *
 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software

 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a

 * add new features. You are highly encouraged to submit your changes as a

 * caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
