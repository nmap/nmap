# Ncat Changelog ($Id$); -*-text-*-

o Reworked the test program test/test-cmdline-split slightly and added
  additional test cases.  Rewrote cmdline_split in ncat_posix.c [Josh Marlow]

o Added a test program, test/test-cmdline-split to test the cmdline_split
  function in test/test-cmdline-split in preparation for an eventual rewrite of
  cmdline_split [Josh Marlow].

Ncat 0.2

o Ported to Windows on Visual C++ Express 2008.  Support isn't perfect because
  of the lack of a fork() call and because we had to implement a hack to get
  select()-like support for stdin on Windows, but most everything works fine.
  We hope to get around these issues in the future. [Kris Katterjohn, Mixter]

o Added IPv6 listen support (including --broker).  Host access control is not
  yet supported. [Kris]

o Added SSL listen support (including --broker) [Kris]

o Fixed SSL and IPv6 connect issues [Mixter]

o Added IPv4 host access control to UDP listener and --broker [Kris]

o Brokering mode now continually listens for connections rather than exiting
  after the last client disconnects. [Kris]

o Changed -l to mostly behave like OpenBSD Netcat.  Instead of -l specifying
  the local port number and -s specifying the local address to listen on, -l
  is a non-option flag and you specify the local address/port like you do
  a host to connect to in client-mode. [Kris]

o Ncat's default port number is now 31337 instead of 5000.  This because 5000
  is used for other protocols, such as UPnP. [Kris]

o Specifying no port number with -l now works to listen on Ncat's default
  port number.  The original Netcat seems to just use an ephemeral port in
  this case, and other incarnations make you specify a port number.  So now
  you don't have to specify a host or port number with -l, in which case
  Ncat listens on any address, port 31337. [Kris]

o Fixed Ncat so that it actually works like it should when transferring a file
  between instances.  Running "ncat -l 3333 <input" and then connecting with
  "ncat host 3333 >output" should send the input file from the server to the
  client.  However actually doing this would either silently fail or complain
  about a broken pipe.  Thanks to eldraco for reporting this problem. [Kris]

o Client-mode Ncat now exits upon receipt of EOF from the network side [Kris]

o Client-mode Ncat now just tries to read anything from the network (still via
  the Nsock library) rather than reading in a line-based manner.  While being
  an improvement in its own right, this is especially helpful for the new
  Telnet negotiation option. [Kris]

o Increased the default network data buffer sizes (reading and writing) from
  a measly 256 bytes to a more respectable 8K for TCP and 128K for UDP.  UDP's
  is this large because a read returns an entire datagram, or discards what's
  left if there is no room. [Kris]

o The proxy options have now changed.  Instead of having separate option names
  for all of the different types of proxy protocols that will be supported,
  --proxy is available to specify the proxy address and optional port, and
  --proxy-type is available to specify the proxy protocol to use. [Kris]

o Added an HTTP proxy server feature, which creates a simple forking HTTP proxy
  server on the listening port (only supports CONNECT).  This is specified by
  "--proxy-type http" in server mode.  [Kris]

o The SOCKSv4 proxy option is now specified by "--proxy-type socks4" instead
  of --socks4-proxy.  This option also now takes the username from --proxy-auth
  rather than the previous user@host:port syntax. [Kris]

o The HTTP proxy option is now specified by "--proxy-type http" instead of
  --http-proxy.  Also, the HTTP CONNECT request now uses CRLF for the EOL
  instead of just LF. [Kris]

o Removed the SOCKS proxy server support because it was broken, didn't have
  any support for SOCKSv5, and we now have an HTTP proxy server for a similar
  purpose. [Kris]

o Fixed --proxy-auth which always caused a segmentation fault. [Kris]

o Fixed an issue which commonly occurred when using --proxy-type socks4 and
  when reading from a piped or redirected stdin.  The problem was that Ncat
  was sending the data read from stdin across the network before it was fully
  connected to the proxy.  Thanks to Jah for noticing this problem. [Kris]

o The output options -o and -x are no longer mutually exclusive.  Also, the
  documented alias for -x (--hex-dump) now works. [Kris]

o Renamed -t (--idle-timeout) to -i [Kris]

o Added -t/--telnet to handle DO/DONT WILL/WONT Telnet negotiations [Kris]

o Added -C/--crlf to try to use CRLF for line-endings.  This comes in handy
  when talking to some stringent servers directly from a terminal in one of
  the many common plain-text protocols which specify CRLF as the required EOL
  sequence. [Kris]

o Added -w/--wait for specifying a connect timeout [Kris]

o Added -g and -G for IPv4 loose source routing [Kris]

o Added -p to specify a local port to bind to in client-mode [Kris]

o Added -n/--nodns to not resolve any hostnames [Mixter]

o Added -c/--sh-exec, which is like -e but executes via /bin/sh [Kris]

o Made -s (set source address) actually work in client-mode [Kris]

o Changed --recvonly and --sendonly to --recv-only and --send-only [Kris]

o Options taking a time (-d, -i, -w) are now more flexible: you can append
  an "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes or "h" for hours (e.g. 30s) [Kris]

o Fixed a bug which could cause Nsock tracing (use of -v one or more times)
  to print very inaccurate times [Kris]

o Removed unused XOR code [Kris]

o Added file dependency checking to the Makefile.  So now, for instance, if
  a header file is modified, running make again will recompile all of the
  files which depend on it. [Kris]

o Improved the build system by removing the automake requirement ([Mixter])
  and by cutting down configure.ac and Makefile.in a lot ([Kris]).  Other
  various build/configure improvements were made as well.

o Lots of documentation rewrites/updates, including separating the man page
  into sections such as "Proxy Options", "Client-Mode Options", etc. [Kris]

o Lots of code cleaning up [Kris]

o Fixed Segmentation faults on outgoing connections that appeared on on
  certain platforms/architectures/compilers.

o Fixed some bounds checking on a SOCKS4 server buffer in ncat_connect.c

o Fixed some documentation typos and --help/usage typos.

Ncat 0.10rc2

  client does and don't hang.

o Fixed some looping read/write issue with EOF handling.
  -- Thanks to Sebastian Garcia.

  output set instead of the default output.
