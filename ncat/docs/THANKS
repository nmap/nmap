Ncat Acknowledgements
=====================

This file is a short rambling of various "thank-you"'s to all
the very generous support and advice received from various
parties.

First and foremost: Thanks go out to Fyodor for all the support
and great ideas throughout the course of development and no doubt
also in the future.

Thanks to Google and the Summer of Code team. The points of
contact with Google being Chris DiBona, Natalie and Jude. Thanks to
you all for making this possible. Without whom I wouldn't even
be writing this.

Also, thank you to all the folks from #c on Undernet who kicked
me in the right direction when things were at their most broken.

Thanks to Jan for all her support and, well, general tolerance. :)

Thanks to all the people who've submitted bug reports, given me
ideas, helped me test Ncat or just given me general encouragement
over the previous years. It is most appreciated.

Finally, thanks to Hobbit for writing the original Netcat; it still
rocks.
