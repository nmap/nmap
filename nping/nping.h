/* CONSTANT DEFINES ***********************************************************
 * @warning It's better not to play with these, because the code may make     *
 * SOME assumptions like "defined value A is an integer greater than defined  *
 * value B" or "value C is an odd integer greater than 0", etc.               */

/* VERBOSITY LEVELS */
/* These are the defines for Nping's internal verbosity levels. Every time
 * you write code for Nping and you have to print something to the terminal,
 * you'll have to choose a verbosity level. You choose a level so your message
 * gets printed only when the user has requested messages from that level to be
 * printed. For example, we have some calls to output functions that print out
 * things like "%d target IPs resolved". We don't want that message to always
 * get printed during  Nping's execution. We only want it out when the user
 * has increase the verbosity.
 *
 * So the thing here is that there are two things that should be taken
 * into account:
 *  1. The current verbosity level that user has supplied from the command line
 *  2. The verbosity level that we supply in our print calls ( nping_print(),
 *     nping_warning(), etc...)
 *
 *  Fortunately Nping output functions already take care of checking the
 *  current verbosity level, so programmers only have to decide which level
 *  should they specify in their output calls. If you are a programmer and
 *  you are using nping_print(), nping_warning() or nping_fatal() calls in Nping's code,
 *  you have to ask yourself: Do I want to print extra information that
 *  shouldn't be printed by default? Or am I printing important stuff like
 *  errors, etc, that should almost always be printed out?
 *
 *  In the first case, you will call the output function using a verbosity
 *  level of VB_0 or higher. Calls that specify VB_0 are printed by default
 *  as VB_0 is the base verbosity level. Calls that specify VB_1 get printed
 *  only when the user has incremented verbosity level by at least one using
 *  option "-v". Same with VB_2 for which the users needs to have specified
 *  either "-v2" or "-v -v".
 *
 *  In the other case, where you are printing errors etc, you have supply
 *  levels like QT_1, QT_2, QT_3 or QT_4. Those are called quiet levels.
 *  They are called quiet levels from a user point of view but they are
 *  verbose to us, programmers, because calls that supply QT_X levels almost
 *  always get printed. This is because base verbosity is VB_0 and that
 *  includes all QT_X levels. So you have to be careful with those. QT_ levels
 *  should only be used to print important stuff like fatal errors, warnings,
 *  and some basic running time information. Level QT_4 is the quiet-est one
 *  and nothing is ever printed out.
 *
 *  Check the comments after each level definition to see how they should be
 *  used. Here are some examples:
 *
 *  nping_fatal(QT_3,"createIPv4(): NULL pointer supplied.");
 *  nping_print(DBG_2,"Resolving specified targets...");
 *  nping_print(VB_0, "Raw packets sent: %llu ", this->stats.getSentPackets() );
 *
