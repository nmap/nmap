.SH "NAME"
nping \- Network packet generation tool / ping utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBnping\fR\ 'u
\fBnping\fR [\fIOptions\fR] {\fItargets\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Nping is an open\-source tool for network packet generation, response analysis and response time measurement\&. Nping allows users to generate network packets of a wide range of protocols, letting them tune virtually any field of the protocol headers\&. While Nping can be used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress tests, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, and other purposes\&.
.PP
Additionally, Nping offers a special mode of operation called the "Echo Mode", that lets users see how the generated probes change in transit, revealing the differences between the transmitted packets and the packets received at the other end\&. See section "Echo Mode" for details\&.
.PP
The output from Nping is a list of the packets that are being sent and received\&. The level of detail depends on the options used\&.
.PP
A typical Nping execution is shown in
Example\ \&1\&. The only Nping arguments used in this example are
\fB\-c\fR, to specify the number of times to target each host,
\fB\-\-tcp\fR
to specify TCP Probe Mode,
\fB\-p 80,433\fR
to specify the target ports; and then the two target hostnames\&.

.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.PP
Everything on the Nping command line that isn\*(Aqt an option or an option argument is treated as a target host specification\&. Nping uses the same syntax for target specifications that Nmap does\&. The simplest case is a single target given by IP address or hostname\&.
.PP
Nping supports CIDR\-style
addressing\&. You can append
/\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Nping will send probes to every IP address for which the first
\fInumbits\fR
are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example,
192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24
would send probes to the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive\&.
192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24
would ping exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host scanme\&.nmap\&.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification
scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16
would send probes to the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is
/0, which targets the whole Internet\&. The largest value is
/32, which targets just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to send probes to 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Nping supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example,
192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254
will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and
192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1
will target the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\-
by itself is the same as
0\-255, but remember to use
0\-
in the first octet so the target specification doesn\*(Aqt look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier
0\-\&.\-\&.13\&.37
will send probes to all IP addresses on the Internet ending in \&.13\&.37\&. This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.PP
IPv6 addresses can only be specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname\&. CIDR and octet ranges aren\*(Aqt supported for IPv6 because they are rarely useful\&.
.PP
Nping accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\*(Aqt need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBnping scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\-\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.SH "OPTION SPECIFICATION"
.PP
Nping is designed to be very flexible and fit a wide variety of needs\&. As with most command\-line tools, its behavior can be adjusted using command\-line options\&. These general principles apply to option arguments, unless stated otherwise\&.
.PP
Options that take integer numbers can accept values specified in decimal, octal or hexadecimal base\&. When a number starts with
0x, it will be treated as hexadecimal; when it simply starts with
0, it will be treated as octal\&. Otherwise, Nping will assume the number has been specified in base 10\&. Virtually all numbers that can be supplied from the command line are unsigned so, as a general rule, the minimum value is zero\&. Users may also specify the word
random
or
rand
to make Nping generate a random value within the expected range\&.
.PP
IP addresses may be given as IPv4 addresses (e\&.g\&.
192\&.168\&.1\&.1), IPv6 addresses (e\&.g\&.
2001:db8:85a3::8e4c:760:7146), or hostnames, which will be resolved using the default DNS server configured in the host system\&.
.PP
Options that take MAC addresses accept the usual colon\-separated 6 hex byte format (e\&.g\&.
00:50:56:d4:01:98)\&. Hyphens may also be used instead of colons (e\&.g\&.
00\-50\-56\-c0\-00\-08)\&. The special word
random
or
rand
sets a random address and the word
broadcast
or
bcast
sets ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\&.
.SH "GENERAL OPERATION"
.PP
Unlike other ping and packet generation tools, Nping supports multiple target host and port specifications\&. While this provides great flexibility, it is not obvious how Nping handles situations where there is more than one host and/or more than one port to send probes to\&. This section explains how Nping behaves in these cases\&.
.PP
When multiple target hosts are specified, Nping rotates among them in round\-robin fashion\&. This gives slow hosts more time to send their responses before another probe is sent to them\&. Ports are also scheduled using round robin\&. So, unless only one port is specified, Nping never sends two probes to the same target host and port consecutively\&.
.PP
The loop around targets is the
\(lqinner loop\(rq
and the loop around ports is the
\(lqouter loop\(rq\&. All targets will be sent a probe for a given port before moving on to the next port\&. Between probes, Nping waits a configurable amount of time called the
\(lqinter\-probe delay\(rq, which is controlled by the
\fB\-\-delay\fR
option\&. These examples show how it works\&.
.PP
.PP One target, three ports, and two rounds\&.

.SH "PROBE MODES"
.PP
Nping supports a wide variety of protocols\&. Although in some cases Nping can automatically determine the mode from the options used, it is generally a good idea to specify it explicitly\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-tcp\-connect\fR (TCP Connect mode)
.RS 4
TCP connect mode is the default mode when a user does not have raw packet privileges\&. Instead of writing raw packets as most other modes do, Nping asks the underlying operating system to establish a connection with the target machine and port by issuing the
connect
system call\&. This is the same high\-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other network\-enabled applications use to establish a connection\&. It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API\&. Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, Nping uses this API to obtain status information on each connection attempt\&. For this reason, you will not be able to see the contents of the packets that are sent or received but only status information about the TCP connection establishment taking place\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-tcp\fR (TCP mode)
.RS 4
TCP is the mode that lets users create and send any kind of TCP packet\&. TCP packets are sent embedded in IP packets that can also be tuned\&. This mode can be used for many different purposes\&. For example you could try to discover open ports by sending TCP SYN messages without completing the three\-way handshake\&. This technique is often referred to as half\-open scanning, because you don\*(Aqt open a full TCP connection\&. You send a SYN packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and then wait for a response\&. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is open, while a RST indicates it\*(Aqs closed\&. If no response is received one could assume that some intermediate network device is filtering the responses\&. Another use could be to see how a remote TCP/IP stack behaves when it receives a non\-RFC\-compliant packet, like one with both SYN and RST flags set\&. One could also do some evil by creating custom RST packets using an spoofed IP address with the intent of closing an active TCP connection\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-udp\fR (UDP mode)
.RS 4
UDP mode can have two different behaviours\&. Under normal circumstances, it lets users create custom IP/UDP packets\&. However, if Nping is run by a user without raw packet privileges and no changes to the default protocol headers are requested, then Nping enters the unprivileged UDP mode which basically sends UDP packets to the specified target hosts and ports using the
sendto
system call\&. Note that in this unprivileged mode it is not possible to see low\-level header information of the packets on the wire but only status information about the amount of bytes that are being transmitted and received\&. UDP mode can be used to interact with any UDP\-based server\&. Examples are DNS servers, streaming servers, online gaming servers, and port knocking/single\-packet
authorization daemons\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-icmp\fR (ICMP mode)
.RS 4
ICMP mode is the default mode when the user runs Nping with raw packet privileges\&. Any kind of ICMP message can be created\&. The default ICMP type is Echo, i\&.e\&., ping\&. ICMP mode can be used for many different purposes, from a simple request for a timestamp or a netmask to the transmission of fake destination unreachable messages, custom redirects, and router advertisements\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-arp\fR (ARP/RARP mode)
.RS 4
ARP lets you create and send a few different ARP\-related packets\&. These include ARP, RARP, DRARP, and InARP requests and replies\&. This mode can ban be used to perform low\-level host discovery, and conduct ARP\-cache poisoning attacks\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-traceroute\fR (Traceroute mode)
.RS 4
Traceroute is not a mode by itself but a complement to TCP, UDP, and ICMP modes\&. When this option is specified Nping will set the IP TTL value of the first probe to 1\&. When the next router receives the packet it will drop it due to the expiration of the TTL and it will generate an ICMP destination unreachable message\&. The next probe will have a TTL of 2 so now the first router will forward the packet while the second router will be the one that drops the packet and generates the ICMP message\&. The third probe will have a TTL value of 3 and so on\&. By examining the source addresses of all those ICMP Destination Unreachable messages it is possible to determine the path that the probes take until they reach their final destination\&.

.RS 4
The IP protocol offers several options which may be placed in packet headers\&. Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options, IP options are rarely seen due to practicality and security concerns\&. In fact, many Internet routers block the most dangerous options such as source routing\&. Yet options can still be useful in some cases for determining and manipulating the network route to target machines\&. For example, you may be able to use the record route option to determine a path to a target even when more traditional traceroute\-style approaches fail\&. Or if your packets are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able to specify a different route with the strict or loose source routing options\&.
.sp
The most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply pass in hexadecimal data as the argument to
\fB\-\-ip\-options\fR\&. Precede each hex byte value with
\ex\&. You may repeat certain characters by following them with an asterisk and then the number of times you wish them to repeat\&. For example,
\ex01\ex07\ex04\ex00*4
is the same as
\ex01\ex07\ex04\ex00\ex00\ex00\ex00\&.
.sp
Note that if you specify a number of bytes that is not a multiple of four, an incorrect IP header length will be set in the IP packet\&. The reason for this is that the IP header length field can only express multiples of four\&. In those cases, the length is computed by dividing the header length by 4 and rounding down\&. This will affect the way the header that follows the IP header is interpreted, showing bogus information in Nping or in the output of any sniffer\&. Although this kind of situation might be useful for some stack stress tests, users would normally want to specify explicit padding, so the correct header length is set\&.
.sp
Nping also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying options\&. Simply pass the letter
R,
T, or
U
to request record\-route, record\-timestamp, or both options together, respectively\&. Loose or strict source routing may be specified with an L or S followed by a space and then a space\-separated list of IP addresses\&.
.sp

.SH "ECHO MODE"
.PP
The "Echo Mode" is a novel technique implemented by Nping which lets users see how network packets change in transit, from the host where they originated to the target machine\&. Basically, the Echo mode turns Nping into two different pieces: the Echo server and the Echo client\&. The Echo server is a network service that has the ability to capture packets from the network and send a copy ("echo them") to the originating client through a side TCP channel\&. The Echo client is the part that generates such network packets, transmits them to the server, and receives their echoed version through a side TCP channel that it has previously established with the Echo server\&.
.PP
This scheme lets the client see the differences between the packets that it sends and what is actually received by the server\&. By having the server send back copies of the received packets through the side channel, things like NAT devices become immediately apparent to the client because it notices the changes in the source IP address (and maybe even source port)\&. Other devices like those that perform traffic shaping, changing TCP window sizes or adding TCP options transparently between hosts, turn up too\&.
.PP
The Echo mode is also useful for troubleshooting routing and firewall issues\&. Among other things, it can be used to determine if the traffic generated by the Nping client is being dropped in transit and never gets to its destination or if the responses are the ones that don\*(Aqt get back to it\&.
.PP
Internally, client and server communicate over an encrypted and authenticated channel, using the Nping Echo Protocol (NEP), whose technical specification can be found in

When running Nping as an Echo client, most options from the regular raw probe modes apply\&. The client may be configured to send specific probes using flags like
\fB\-\-tcp\fR,
\fB\-\-icmp\fR
or
\fB\-\-udp\fR\&. Protocol header fields may be manipulated normally using the appropriate options (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-ttl\fR,
\fB\-\-seq\fR,
\fB\-\-icmp\-type\fR, etc\&.)\&. The only exceptions are ARP\-related flags, which are not supported in Echo mode, as protocols like ARP are closely related to the data link layer and its probes can\*(Aqt pass through different network segments\&.

This option tells Nping to run as an Echo server\&.
\fIpassphrase\fR
is a sequence of ASCII characters that is used used to generate the cryptographic keys needed for encryption and authentication in a given session\&. The passphrase should be a secret that is also known by the clients, and it may contain any number of printable ASCII characters\&. Passphrases that contain whitespace or special characters must be enclosed in double quotes\&. Note that although it is not recommended, it is possible to use empty passphrases, supplying

\fB\-\-echo\-server\fR, it specifies the port on which the server listens for connections\&. If it is used with
\fB\-\-echo\-client\fR, it specifies the port to connect to on the remote host\&. By default, port number 9929 is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nc\fR, \fB\-\-no\-crypto\fR (Disable encryption and authentication)
.RS 4
This option asks Nping not to use any cryptographic operations during an Echo session\&. In practical terms, this means that the Echo side channel session data will be transmitted in the clear, and no authentication will be performed by the server or client during the session establishment phase\&. When
\fB\-\-no\-crypto\fR
is used, the passphrase supplied with
\fB\-\-echo\-server\fR
or
\fB\-\-echo\-client\fR
is ignored\&.
.sp
This option must be specified if Nping was compiled without openSSL support\&. Note that, for technical reasons, a passphrase still needs to be supplied after the \-\-echo\-client or \-\-echo\-server flags, even though it will be ignored\&.
.sp
The \-\-no\-crypto flag might be useful when setting up a public Echo server, because it allows users to connect to the Echo server without the need for any passphrase or shared secret\&. However, it is strongly recommended to not use \-\-no\-crypto unless absolutely necessary\&. Public Echo servers should be configured to use the passphrase "public" or the empty passphrase (\-\-echo\-server "") as the use of cryptography does not only provide confidentiality and authentication but also message integrity\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-once\fR (Serve one client and quit)
.RS 4
This option asks the Echo server to quit after serving one client\&. This is useful when only a single Echo session wants to be established as it eliminates the need to access the remote host to shutdown the server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-safe\-payloads\fR (Zero application data before echoing a packet)
.RS 4
This option asks the Echo server to erase any application layer data found in client packets before echoing them\&. When the option is enabled, the Echo server parses the packets received from Echo clients and tries to determine if they contain data beyond the transport layer\&. If such data is found, it is overwritten with zeroes before transmitting the packets to the appropriate Echo client\&.
.sp
Echo servers can handle multiple simultaneous clients running multiple echo sessions in parallel\&. In order to determine which packet needs to be echoed to which client and through which session, the Echo server uses an heuristic algorithm\&. Although we have taken every security measure that we could think of to prevent that a client receives an echoed packet that it did not generate, there is always a risk that our algorithm makes a mistake and delivers a packet to the wrong client\&. The \-\-safe\-payloads option is useful for public echo servers or critical deployments where that kind of mistake cannot be afforded\&.

The output clearly shows the presence of a NAT device in the client\*(Aqs local network\&. Note how the captured packet (CAPT) differs from the SENT packet: the source address for the original packets is in the reserved 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8 range, while the address seen by the server is 80\&.38\&.10\&.21, the Internet side address of the NAT device\&.

In this example, the output is a bit more tricky\&. The absence of error messages shows that the Echo client has successfully established an Echo session with the server\&. However, no CAPT packets can be seen in the output\&. This means that none of the transmitted packets reached the server\&. Interestingly, a TCP SYN\-ACK packet was received in response to the first TCP\-SYN packet (and also, it is known that the target host does not have port 80 open)\&. This behavior reveals the presence of a transparent web proxy cache server (which in this case is an old MS ISA server)\&.

This option lets you specify the number of times that Nping should loop over target hosts (and in some cases target ports)\&. Nping calls these
\(lqrounds\(rq\&. In a basic execution with only one target (and only one target port in TCP/UDP modes), the number of rounds matches the number of probes sent to the target host\&. However, in more complex executions where Nping is run against multiple targets and multiple ports, the number of rounds is the number of times that Nping sends a complete set of probes that covers all target IPs and all target ports\&. For example, if Nping is asked to send TCP SYN packets to hosts 192\&.168\&.1\&.0\-255 and ports 80 and 433, then 256 \(mu 2\ \&=\ \&512 packets are sent in one round\&. So if you specify
\fB\-c 100\fR, Nping will loop over the different target hosts and ports 100 times, sending a total of 256 \(mu 2 \(mu 100\ \&=\ \&51200 packets\&. By default Nping runs for 5 rounds\&. If a value of 0 is specified, Nping will run continuously\&.

This option lets you use a custom BPF filter\&. By default Nping chooses a filter that is intended to capture most common responses to the particular probes that are sent\&. For example, when sending TCP packets, the filter is set to capture packets whose destination port matches the probe\*(Aqs source port or ICMP error messages that may be generated by the target or any intermediate device as a result of the probe\&. If for some reason you expect strange packets in response to sent probes or you just want to sniff a particular kind of traffic, you can specify a custom filter using the BPF syntax used by tools like tcpdump\&.

Also, it may be useful when using Nping to detect active hosts or open ports (e\&.g\&. sending probes to all TCP ports in a /24 subnet)\&.
