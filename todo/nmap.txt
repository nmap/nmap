TODO $Id: TODO 11866 2009-01-24 23:10:05Z fyodor $ -*-text-*-

o Work on Nmap on Mobile devices, particularly Android.  Would be
  great to get it in Google Play store, for example.  An official
  version with a workable GUI.  For now, people have to do manual work
  and it isn't as well tested either:
  https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Android . If this is successful, we could
  consider iOS.

o Nmap performance work.  Particularly with --min-rate.

o Consider re-architecting Nmap to have more of a scanning pipeline
approach rather than fixed sets of hosts which start and finish one
phase and then move into the next in parallel.  This could potentially
allow us to add hosts one by one to a phase as other hosts finish that
phase and, ideally, the phases could run in parallel too.

o Nmap Network Scanning, 2nd Edition work [placeholder]

o Organize nselib into a hierarchy. A library "dirname/filename.lua" can be
  required as "dirname.filename". We would need to ensure the installers
  (Makefile, OS X, Windows, RPM) can handle this. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q3/364

o We should work to reduce Zenmap's memory consumption. We used to
  commonly get error reports from people who load so many systems that
  Zenmap gives an out of memory error and crashes.  For example, see
  this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q2/46
  After committing patch at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q2/429,
  we no longer get the error report but the problem still exists.
  The problem seems to lie in a very large Nmap Output being stored
  in memory and a possible fix seems to be to use a file based paging
  system.

o Consider making a version of Nmap for Apple's official Mac App
  Store.  A particular concern with the downloadable Mac version of
  Nmap is that Apple's new "Mountain Lion" release may require users
  to jump through hoops to install unsigned non-app-store content per
  their "Gatekeeper" "feature".  Though maybe signing the app will be
  enough.  There may also be an issue with the "Sandboxing"
  requirement for App Store apps starting June 2012.  Will Nmap be
  able to request all the permissions it needs?  Ignoring the
  technical challenges for the moment, what will users prefer?

o Do a roll up on (state, TTL) pair instead of just state so that TTL
  info is not lost when doing roll up on port states.
  See thread at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q3/93

o Consider looking into differring TTL values during OS detection
  phase and choose a port that is (hopefully) not firewalled to get
  a better chance at correct result. See thread at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q3/33

o [Zenmap] Look into and refactor code which uses the (very slow) += operation
  on strings. http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q2/432 helped improve speeds
  for opening files (from hours to seconds) and it seems like more speedups
  can be done in other places.

o Look into moving our Mac building/testing system into a virtual
  machine or leased server sort of environment so that multiple Nmap
  developers can access it and nobody has to keep a stack of Mac Minis
  in their closet.

o INFRASTRUCTURE: Upgrade seclists to use Mailman 3, which apparently
  has many improvements.

o We should fix nsedoc generation so it doesn't fail when blocks like
  @usage, @output, etc. are followed by a local declaration.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q2/331.  If for some reason this
  just can't be fixed, we will have to document the heck out of it, I
  suppose.

o When scanning your own IP from Windows, Nmap currently recognizes
  the problem (can't do a raw scan like that on Windows) and skips the
  SYN scan, leading to Nmap printing a bunch of ports in "unknown"
  state at the end.  Nmap should probably act like unprivileged mode
  in this case (e.g. do a connect scan, etc.).  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q3/519

o Investigate Checkmarx static analysis report of Nmap source tree
  that someone sent us on Feb 12.  It looks like mostly false positives,
  but we should go through to check for any real bugs or even possible
  security issues.  Fyodor has the report.

o INFRASTRUCTURE: Consider updating our svn-mailer.py (and conf file)
  to the latest official version.  First check whether there is a
  later official version and whether it has material changes.  We're
  currently using one from
  subversion-1.4.2/tools/hook-scripts/mailer/mailer.py.

o Consider a two-stage model for IPv6 subnet/pattern support
  o Right now you can try to scan a /64, for example, and Nmap will try
    to iterate through them all (and of course never complete).  So
    perhaps Nmap should first look at a specification and decide if it
    should use other techniques like multicast discovery instead.

o Move advanced IPv6 host discovery features from NSE into core Nmap.
  We'll probably add the functionality of
  targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst, targets-ipv6-multicast-echo, and
  maybe targets-ipv6-multicast-slaac.
  - The idea is that Nmap does them automatically if it gets a large
    target specification and sees that it is local so can be multicast
    pinged.

o We should figure out why (at least with Nping) raw ethernet frame
  sends seem to be taking significantly longer than raw socket sends
  (e.g. using --send-ip or the OS-provided ping utility).  This has
  been reproduced on Linux and Windows.  Here's a thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q4/424
  o Note that David and I tried to reproduce this on his machine and
  on 'web' and 'research' machines and could not reproduce.  Still
  happens with Fyodor's machine connected with WiFi.  Fyodor should
  test on the same machine using wired and see if that changes anything.

o Implement some improvements to dns-ip6-arpa.nse, as describe at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/45.
  - Also consider a move to "fire and forget" logic.  Just blast out
  the queries that we know we have to make, and then read any replies
  that may happen to come back. (but still try not to introduce
  inaccuracy (missed hosts) by flooding the network.

o Treat the input to the escape function in xml.cc as UTF-8, not just
  ASCII. Good UTF-8 should survive into the output; i.e., "\xe2\x98\xbb"
  should become "\xe2\x98\xbb" in the output, not "&#xe2;&#x98;&#xbb;".
  If the input happens not to be UTF-8, (like the file name in
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2013/q1/180), I suppose we can
  individually encode each byte of each invalid sequence: "\xba\xda\xbf"
  becomes "&#xba;&#xda;&#xbf;". Can probably do this with simple
  byte->rune and rune->byte functions as in
  http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html.

o We should probably redo the Nmap header (e.g. on https://nmap.org) to
  make it more attractive.  Or, at a minimum we should update the
  screenshots and think about which links we really need (some of those
  pages aren't really updated any more).

o Test a hierarchical classifier for IPv6 OS detection. Our classifier
  currently treats, for example, some localhost Linux fingerprints as
  separate classes from remote Linux fingerprints, simply because we
  lose precision if we lump them together (for example TCP window size
  differs across certain Linux versions when measured remotely, but
  not on localhost). This leads to the linear classifier having to use
  narrow margins between fingerprints that are really very similar. I
  want to try a tree of classification where each non-leaf node is a
  separately trained classifier and each leaf node is a final
  classification. The first layer of the hierarchy would be something
  like
      (linux windows solaris aix ... other)
  where "linux" would contain *all* the Linux fingerprints in a single
  class. Lower levels would be like
      (linux-2.4 linux-2.6)
      (windows-xp windows-vista windows-7)
  Lower levels will include only those fingerprints in their parent
  class, so we don't even think about Windows when classifying
  Linux. Probably three or four levels will be sufficient. There may
  be a principled or automatic way to build this hierarchy, but I
  suspect playing it by ear will be sufficient. Talk to David for more
  of his thinking on this topic.

o Maybe we should rename dns-brute to dns-brute-enum since it is so different
  from our traditional brute force authentication cracking -brute scripts?

o NSE WORK (note that this is mostly infrastructure because script
  ideas are generally put on the script ideas page instead:
  https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap_Script_Ideas)
  o Review NSE-based port scanning and RST idle scan.
    http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/307. [Henri and Hani?]

o Maybe we should add an analysis or reporting or intelligence (or
  different name) for our NSE scripts which don't send any packets, but
  simply analyze Nmap's existing data and report when useful.

o Install some sort of svnview webapp for svn.nmap.org which is
  wrapped in Insecure chrome, allows people to click link for direct
  file download, probably shows revision history and allows users to
  see older versions, etc.

o Process Nmap survey and send out results [Fyodor]

o Nping (we think) will stop after 2^32 rounds even when "-c 0" is
  given.  We should probably make this a 64-bit integrer so that "-c
  0" will go essentially forever and so that users can give values
  higher than 4 billion.

o Nscan work [placeholder]
 - Hosted Nmap system

o Add CPE entries to OS fingerpting DB entries which still lack them.
  This is a gradual process since almost all of the missing ones
  aren't in the official CPE dictionary either and it can take a lot
  of research to decide on an appropriate entry.  Milestones so far:
  - 3/21/12: We have entries for 2,601 of 3,572 fingerprints (971
    missing; 73% coverage)
  - 11/5/12: We have entries for 3,285 of 3,907 fingerpritns (622
    missing; 84% coverage)
  - 11/12/12: We have entries for 3,558 of 3,946 fingerprints (388
    missing; 90% coverage).

o [Zenmap] should actually parse and use script results. See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1108
  - We have an initial prototype, but probably need to redo because it
    doesn't present the results in the way we'd like yet due to
    problems implementing such a presentation with GTK, etc.

o Make Zenmap settings get upgraded when the Zenmap executable is
  upgraded. The per-user configuration files such as scan_profile.usp
  and zenmap.conf are never overwritten once installed by Zenmap, so
  changes and fixes to those files don't reach anyone who has
  installed Zenmap already. This is most noticeable with changes to
  profiles and highlight definitions are notably affected. This fix
  may involve hard-coding settings that are not normally configured by
  users (like highlighting) or updating the per-user files at startup
  (only those parts that haven't been changed by the user).

o We should offer partial results when a host timeouts. I (Fyodor)
  have been against this in the past, but maybe the value is
  sufficient to be worth the maintenance headaches.  Many users have
  asked for this.  If we do implement this, we may want to only print
  results for the COMPLETED phases (e.g. host discovery, port
  scanning, version detection, traceroute, NSE, etc.)  Trying to print
  partial results of a port scan or NSE or the like might be a pain.
  And if we print some results for a host which timeouts, we should
  give a very clear warning that the results for that host are
  incomplete. As an example, here is someone who hacked Nmap source
  code to achieve this: http://seclists.org/pen-test/2010/Mar/108.
  o Another benefit would be that it would allow us to clean
    up/regularize the host output code. Right now there are I think
    three places where a host's final output can be printed. If,
    instead, that code just looked at what information was available and
    printed that out only, we could potentially isolate it in just one
    place.
  o This also might let us provide a feature for skipping the rest of
    an Nmap phase which is going too slowly (I think that has its own
    Nmap TODO item).

o [Nsock] Some SSL connections that used to work now fail; find out
  why. http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/788. Narrowed down to
  r19801 in http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q1/12.

o [NSE] Consider a system where scripts can tell if any other scripts
  depend on them.  They could then use that to determine whether they
  should bother storing information in the registry.  For example,
  snmp-interfaces could store the discovered table if another script
  (such as a mac address geolocator script) depends on it.

o [NSE] Consider whether we need script.db for performance reasons at
  all or should just read through all the scripts and parse on the fly.
  See: [http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0221.html]

o A couple minor nsedoc issues (see
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q1/1095):
 o After the ssh-hostkey portrule was added, nsedoc seems to be
   generating a blank "Script types" filed for the script:
   http://localhost:8082/nsedoc/scripts/ssh-hostkey.html
   o This is happening because "portrule" and "hostrule" appear later in
     the script, and NSEDoc thinks it is their definition, and there is
     no NSEDoc there.
       local ActionsTable = {
         -- portrule: retrieve ssh hostkey
         portrule = portaction,
         -- postrule: look for duplicate hosts (same hostkey)
         postrule = postaction
       }
 o ssh-hostkey and rmi-dumpregistry each have two @output sections,
   and NSEDoc is only showing the second one.  We should probably just
   combine them into one @output section, and maybe make nsedoc give a
   warning in this case.  Or we could make nsedoc handle multiple
   @outputs.

o Add general regression unit testing system to Nmap
 o David has created a system for Ncat which could serve as a
   model.

o Make version detection and NSE timing system more dynamic so that
  the concurrency can change based on network conditions/ability.
  After all, beefy systems on fast connections should be able to handle
  far more parallel connections than slower systems.
  o At a minimum, this at least warrants more benchmark testing.

o We should run at least one SCTP service on scanme.  Daniel
  Roethlisberger has made available dummy services which support IPv4
  and IPv6 (see http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/450).
  Alternatively, we could run some sort of "real" SCTP application(s)
  (preferably one which is relatively simple, easy to install, secure,
  and supports IPv6).

o Create new default username list:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/798
  o Could be a SoC Ncrack task, though should prove useful for Nmap
    too
  o We probably want to support several lists.  Like an admin/default
    list like "root", "admin", "administrator", "web", "user", "test",
    and also a general list which we obtain from spidering from
    emails, etc.

o Improve Nsock proxies system
 - Add SSL support
 - Add proxy authentication
 - Switch Ncat to using Nsock proxy system rather than it's own
   built-in support.
 - Move the code which is shared with ncat to nbase (URL parsing code,
   for instance).
 - Add socks4a/socks5 support. This requires to figure out how to
   enter the nsock proxy code w/o having the target IP address. No huge
   technical blocker there though, only design choices to make.
 - Nping could potentially use it as well (could be useful for
   measuring latency and reliability of a given proxy chain, for
   example).
 - Add proxy support to connect() scan.  This would mean moving
   connect scan to nsock.

o [NCAT] Send one line at a time when --delay is in effect. This is
  cumbersome to do until Nsock supports buffered reading.

o [NCAT] Make the HTTP proxy support the chunked transfer encoding,
  then change it to be HTTP/1.1 and support pipelining.

o [NCAT] Drop privileges once it has started up, bound the ports it
  needs to, etc.

o [NCAT] Work as a SOCKS4a/SOCKSv5 proxy.

o [NCAT] Resolve names through the proxy when possible.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2012/q2/768

o [NSE] Script writing contest (something to think about)

o We should document an official way to compile/test refguide.xml so
  people can more easily test their changes to it.  This will probably
  involve moving legal-notices.xml into /nmap/docs, among other
  things.
  o Note that nping has its own /nmap/nping/docs/genmanpage.sh - we
  could look at how that could apply to Nmap.

o Move Zenmap man page from nmap/docs/ to nmap/zenmap/docs to match
  the man page location for ncat and ndiff.
 o Don't break packaging/build system
 o Don't break the system for posting html to web site. 
 o Consider standardizing names for nping and ncrack man pages as well.
 [Fyodor]

o [NSE] MSRPC - Improve domain support all around -- in particular,
  let the user give the domain in the format DOMAIN\username or
  username@DOMAIN anywhere that usernames are accepted. Suggested
  at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/389

o [NSE] Combine similar MSRPC scripts, especially the "get info"
  stuff.  See this thread on combining
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1023).  This was suggested by
  Ron at http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/389.

o [Zenmap] Investigate getting new OS icon art. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1090

o We should probably enhance scan stats--maybe we can add a full-scan
  completion time estimate? Some ideas here:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/1007

o [NSE] Do some benchmarking of our brute.nse.  We should check the
  performance with different levels of thread parallelism.  Our
  initial results show that it isn't helping much for vnc-brute or for
  drda-brute (which is currently using the multi-thread feature
  directly rather than through brute.nse library).  We should figure
  out why the threads aren't helping more, and whether there is
  something we can do to fix it.  It would also be interesting to
  compare speed with Ncrack for services we have in common.

o Start project to make Nmap a Featured Article on Wikipedia.
 - See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/614

o Add Nmap web board/forum
 - First step is looking at the available software for this.
 - Nmap subreddit exists: https://www.reddit.com/r/nmap

o [Zenmap] Consider a couple ideas from Norris Carden
  (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/228):
 - remember last save and/or open location for new saves and/or opens
 - default save location option

o [Nsock] Consider adding server support to Nsock so it can accept
  multiple connections and multiplex the SD's, like it does for
  clients.  This could potentially be used by Ncat and Nping echo
  mode.  Currently Ncat server doesn't use Nsock at all, while Nping
  echo mode basically polls, repeating a loop of 1s in nsock_loop
  followed by a nonblocking accept().  Then Nping gives the SD's to
  Nsock to manage.

o Consider implementing both global and per-host congestion control in
  the IPv6 OS detection engine. Currently it handles congestion globally
  (one CWND and SSTHRESH shared by all hosts). This works fine but it
  may not be the most efficient approach: if the congestion is not
  in our network segment but in a target's and we are os-scanning
  hosts in different networks, then all hosts get "penalized" because
  there is congestion in another network, not in theirs.

o [Nsock] Consider implementing a nsock_pcap_close() function or making
  nsp_delete() call pcap_close() when pcap IODs are used. Currently valgrind
  warns about a socket descriptor left opened (at least in Nping).

o Consider rethinking Nmap's -s* syntax for specifing scan types
  o Current problems with this -s syntax:
    o We already use like 20 of the 26 letters, so we end up with
      things like SCTP scan using -sY
    o Can make Nmap command lines hard to read, particularly given
      that we often need to improvise to find a letter which isn't
      taken.
    o Problematic for scan types -sI and -b which require arguments
    o Inconsistencies.  For example, -sC and -sV do script scan and
    version detection, respectively, and yet for OS detection we use
    -O.  Also, control flow (-sP, -sL) is used with -s, which further
    overloads the options.
  o Possible solution:
    o We are enabling -Pn and -sn as preferred notations for -PN and
      -sP which mean "no ping" and "no port scan".  Those match the
      already existing -n for "no DNS".  The problem with -sP is that it
      implies "ping only", when what it really should mean is "disable
      port scan" because you may want to do NSE, OS detection,
      traceroute, etc. still.
    o We might want to just give them normal option strings, so you
      could do --maimon instead of -sM, for example.  For extremely
      common options such as SYN scan, UDP scan, version detection, we
      could perhaps find good single letter options as an alias to the
      longer one.
    o Another idea is to use something like --scantype syn,udp,sctp,
      which is a lot longer for single-type scans, but shorter when
      you're combining mulitiple ones.  Doesn't allow for individual
      scan arguments easily.  I (Fyodor) think I prefer the idea above
      of just givem them top level arguments.
    o If we keep -s*, we could just give it one defined function, such
      as selecting port scan type, or control flow.
  o Obviously this will take some discussion/brainstorming on nmap-dev.

o Do -p- Internet UDP scans.

o Scanning through proxies
 o Nmap should be able to scan through proxy servers, particularly now
   that we have an NSE script for detectiong open proxies and now that
   Ncat can act as proxy client or server.
 o Requirements:
   o Would be nice to be able to chain through multiple proxy servers of
     different types.
   o Would be nice to be able to spread the load amongst multiple
     proxies.
   o Should support port scanning, version detection, and NSE.  In
     other words, nsock should support proxies.
   o Support IPv4 and v6
   o Need to figure out how to get good performance.  Pool of
     connections to proxy or proxies for concurrency?  HTTP pipelining?
   o Support the different varieties of proxies: socks4, socks4a,
     socks5, HTTP GET (if possible), HTTP CONNECT.  Note that GET
     proxies present some challenges since the error messages may not
     be standard, etc.
   o Maybe auto-detect the proxy type so that Nmap can try the most
     efficient scanning method first?
   o I've been asked to support basic, ntlm, and digest authentication
     if possible.
 o Implementation ideas: 
   o There is a patch by Zoltan Panczel (http://nmap-dev.fw.hu) and it
     has been improved by Jacob Appelbaum in nmap-exp/ioerror/ .  This
     patch doesn't handle things like parallelization, but it may be a
     good proof of concept.
   o This might not be appropriate for ultra_scan ... perhaps would be
     better to write a general scanning engine for abusing
     applications for port scanning purposes.  This could handle
     scanning through proxies and the existing FTP bounce scan would
     also be ported to this engine (or, frankly, we could probably get
     away with removing FTP bounce).  rembrandt at jpberlin.de tells me
     that you can also do this with the "forwarding" commands on IMAP
     servers.  Whoever does this should probably start by reading the
     code for the main port scanning engine (ultra_scan()) and also
     the version detection code (service_scan()).  And the version
     detection paper at https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html.  If you
     understand all that, you may be ready for this project :).  This
     is important, because it is easy to do poorly.  The tough part is
     high performance and clean code which is general enough that all
     these different applications can be scanned through using the
     same basic engine.  You should run your ideas by nmap-dev in as
     much detail as possible before starting.
   o David: I'm starting to think about building proxy support into
     Nsock and then implementing -sT with Nsock instead of ultra_scan.

o [Web] Consider adding training/introduction videos to the Nmap site
 o Would be great to have a (5 minute or less) promotional video
   introduction to each tool (Nmap, Zenmap, Ncat, Ndiff) on its web
   page.
 o They need to be good to be useful--the sort of the quality you see
   in Laura Chappell's Wireshark videos or James Messer's Nmap videos
   or Irongeek's videos (http://www.irongeek.com).
 o Besides the promotional videos, users would probably enjoy more
   in-depth video instructions (e.g. covering the Nmap Network
   Scanning topics).
 o Here's an example product page with lots of videos (we may not go
   that far): http://www.splunk.com/product

o The Zenmap translation system
  (https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-lang.html) has been pretty successful
  so far.  We should consider doing the same for Nmap.  After all, we
  already have the reference guide in 16 languages at
  https://nmap.org/docs.html.  We should definitely try to use the same
  translation methods for Zenmap as we do for Nmap.  In fact, maybe we
  can create a combined PO file Nmap, Zenmap, Ncat, and Ndiff so that
  they can all be translated and maintained together. Something to
  consider: calling setlocale can change the behavior of functions like
  isalpha. Locale-dependent functions need to be checked for security
  risks.

o [NSE] Consider whether we should include some sort of NSE debugger.  Or we
  could include something simpler.  For example, Nmap now provides a
  traceback (with sufficient debugging/verbosity) when a script ends
  in error.  For some inspiration/ideas, look at Diman's NSE
  debugger (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0228.html).

o [NSE] Support routing http requests through proxies.

o [NSE] Would be great if NSE scripts could be made to NOT
  run as root if they don't have to.

o [NSE] Security Review
 o Consider what, if any, vulnerabilities or security risks NSE has
   with respect to buffer overflows, format string bugs, any other
   maliciously formatted responses from target systems, etc.  Maybe
   address the known risk of malicious scripts too.
 o Consider that NSE runs scripts as root

o More security auditing of Nmap code (it never hurts to do more proactive
  security auditing).

o Figure out and document (in at least the Ncat user's guide) the best
  way to use Ncat for chaining through proxies.  One option is this
  sort of thing:
  ncat -l localhost 1234 --sh-exec "ncat --proxy A.A.A.A B.B.B.B"
  ncat --proxy localhost:1234 C.C.C.C
  If you had two proxies A.A.A.A and B.B.B.B, connecting to C.C.C.C.
  With another listener/--sh-exec pair for each additional proxy.
  But perhaps we can make it easier by adding it to the syntax.

o Look into whether we should loosen/change the global congestion
  control system to address possible cases of one target host with many
  dropped packets slowing down the whole group.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html .
  * Related possibility: Fix --nogcc to gracefully handle ping scans.
    Right now it seems to go WAY TOO FAST (e.g. several thousand
    packets per second on my DSL line).
  * [12/22/09] David says: It still is in one case that I've
    documented on my wiki. I had an idea to fix it, but on testing it
    it didn't work. The idea was to treat the global congestion limit
    differently. Instead of dropping it down to the minimum level on a
    drop as is done currently, I thought about only dropping it by the
    amount that the individual host limit drops. For example, if a
    host had a drop and its limit fell from 25 to 1, then the global
    limit would change (if it was at 100 to begin with) to 76, not all
    the way down to 2 or whatever it is.  The idea being that the
    global limit is most important at the beginning of a scan, when
    there's no information to set host limits, and every host wants to
    send all its first probes at once. See
    http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/PerformanceNotesArchive2#global-cc. I
    am convinced, though, that some sort of global control is
    necessary. There's a reason that a web browser limits the number
    of connections it will make, and doesn't try to download every
    image file at once and count on the fairness of TCP to sort it
    out.

o libnmap organization for UNIX and Windows
  o Then change Nmap and Zenmap to simply call this library
  o It is interesting to look at: http://www.gnupg.org/gpgme.html

o Deal with UDP retransmission for version detection (I think I
  should just do a second run of all probes for UDP if it fails to
  match anything).  The advantage there is that no retransmissions are
  neccessary if the service is found.  Then again, per-probe
  retransmission would let us redo the most likely probes (the one(s)
  that match the port number) quickly.  Lost packets should probably
  affect ideal_parallelism.

o Make RPM relocatable (requires somehow avoiding storing paths in the
  binary)
  - That may be easier now that David has made some big improvements
    in detecting where the binary is cross-platform and then looking for
    data files based on that location.

o Nmaprc-related - Create a system to store Nmap defaults/preferences
  in an nmaprc file.
  o nmaprc should be in ~/.nmap on UNIX
  o On Windows, we may need a registry key to find the .nmaprc
  o Perhaps Lua could be used as the format?
  o .nmaprc for keeping defaults, etc.
    o Nmaprc infrastructure, hook to new timing variables
    o Nmaprc man page
    o Default timing mode
    o Default NSE arguments, such as user agent
    o Maybe Default source IP (-S) argument
    o should be a way to specify your own .nmaprc
    o Maybe lets you add a directory and template for saving all
     scans. 
    o Maybe let you define "scan profiles" like is done with Zenmap.
      There would then be a command-line option to select the profile used.

o Get new Zenmap logo
 o consider putting back on top-right of command constructor wizard
 (there used to be umit logo there).
 o Maybe that can be done after the release by soliciting ideas.

o Create or collect some great ./configure ascii art.

o Look at all the pcap functions, there are some like
  pcap_findalldevs() which could be quite useful.  There are mails to
  the Nmap list relating to suggested improvements --
  http://seclists.org/lists/nmap-dev/2004/Apr-Jun/0024.html .
  Actually I do indirectly use that for Windows. I wonder if they work
  for UNIX?

o perhaps each 'match' line in nmap-service-probes should have a
  maximum lines, bytes, and/or time by which a response should be
  available.  Once that much time (or many bytes or lines) have passed,
  that match can be considered 'failed' and ignored in subsequent runs.
  Once all matches are considered failed, that probe is done.  This
  could be a useful optimization and is arguably better than the less
  granular 'totalwaitms'.  Or I could just have a simple function that
  looks at whether a given regex could possibly match something
  starting with the received data (not too hard since almost all of
  the current regexes are anchored).  But before doing this, I should
  look long and hard at how many of the probes have every match
  capable of doing this.  In particular, many of the softmatch lines
  don't offer many chars anchored at the front.

o Separate nbase into its own Windows library in the same way as Andy did
   with iphlpapi .
