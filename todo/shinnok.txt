In progress:
============

o We should offer partial results when a host
  timeouts. I (Fyodor) have been against this in the past, but maybe
  the value is sufficient to be worth the maintenance headaches.  Many
  users have asked for this.  If we do implement this, we may want to
  only print results for the COMPLETED phases (e.g. host discovery,
  port scanning, version detection, traceroute, NSE, etc.)  Trying to
  print partial results of a port scan or NSE or the like might be a
  pain.  And if we print some results for a host which timeouts, we
  should give a very clear warning that the results for that host are
  incomplete. As an example, here is someone who hacked Nmap source
  code to achieve this: http://seclists.org/pen-test/2010/Mar/108.
  o Another benefit would be that it would allow us to clean
    up/regularize the host output code. Right now there are I think
    three places where a host's final output can be printed. If,
    instead, that code just looked at what information was available and
    printed that out only, we could potentially isolate it in just one
    place.
  o This also might let us provide a feature for skipping the rest of
    an Nmap phase which is going too slowly (I think that has its own
    Nmap TODO item).

Hanging(waiting for further input, etc..):
==========================================

o Nmap *poor's man* test suite by expanding on what I already have in
  /nmap-exp/shinnok/nmap-test-script.

o NMAP reports different service results every so often with the same port.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/815

o Review latest revision of Marek's ncat_proxy.patch - DONE
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/573
  o Commit approval pending

Pending:
========

Pending (low priority):
=======================

o E-mail nmap-dev with GProfiles /ncrack
  o Create new default username list:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q1/798
  o Could be a SoC Ncrack task, though should prove useful for Nmap
    too
  o We probably want to support several lists.  Like an admin/default
    list like "root", "admin", "administrator", "web", "user", "test",
    and also a general list which we obtain from spidering from
    emails, etc.

Potential:
==========

COMPLETED:
==========

o Add a --append-output option to ncat. [DONE - r25737]

o libpcre/pcre.h - is cleared upon make distclean thus leaving the SVN
  working directory dirty
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/708

o De-duplicate code by unifying ncat_broker.c and ncat_listen.c code paths,
  either as a single file in ncat_listen.c or merge duplicate code in
  ncat_listen.c and keep only broker specific code in ncat_broker.c(it it's a
  lot of code, otherwise ncat_listen.c would do just fine).

o Nmap should defer address parsing in arguments until it has read
  through all the args.  Otherwise you get an error if you use like -S
  with an IPv6 address before you put -6 in the command line.  You
  get a similar problem (on David's IPv6 branch) if you do "-A -6"
  (but "-6 -A works properly).

o Delve into Lua and NSE and try to write some scripts to get the hang
  of it and gain a better understanding of the NSE engine in Nmap.
  o Written two NSE scripts, http-reverse-ip and http-google-email that
    can be found in /nmap-exp/shinnok/nse.

o E-mail nmap-dev with QtCreator usage steps for Nmap

o Ncat hangs on ssl -> REFACTORING
  some refactoring left to be done to reduce code duplication
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/842
  o Commit current switch/ifdef refactoring patch.
  o Research code deduplication even further.

o Ncat chat (at least in ssl mode) no longer gives the banner greeting
  when I connect.  This worked in r23918, but not in r24185, which is
  the one running on chat.nmap.org as of 6/20/11.  Verify by running
  "ncat --ssl -v chat.nmap.org"

o Pending uncompleted SSL handshakes when in --exec* listening mode make
  Ncat consume 100% cpu(core/thread).
  Possible solutions:
    o Listen on the union of the two sets in ncat_listen.c composed of the
      current set and a secondary one, ssl_pending which should include the
      pending ssl hanshake sockets.
    o Timeout ssl handshakes.
    o Delay adding the exec output pipes to fselect/WaitForMultipleObjects 
      until the ssl handshake has been completed.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/988
---

o Fix ncat.xml(the input for the man page) examples section. - David came up
  with the final right fix on this one.

o Ncat should close its socket and refuse further connections after the first
  one, if invoked without --keep-open. That's what traditional netcat does
  too. - DONE [r24197]
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/944
  o Add TEST in ncat-test.pl - DONE [r24373]

o Closing Zenmap without stopping the scan first will leave nmap running in 
  the process list on Windows. [r24308]
  [Actually, Zenmap was unable to kill the nmap scan processes at all on 
  Windows]

o Zenmap should wait for the return exit code of the nmap scanning subprocess
  upon killing it(canceled scan), otherwise the subprocesses will enter a 
  defunct(zombie) state.[r24235]

o Fix build_icmp_raw and build_igmp_raw filling the packet data payload
  with zeroes instead of the supplied random data, when nmap is invoked
  with --data-length.[r24127]

o Investigate and document how easy it is to drop Ncat.exe by itself
  on other systems and have it work. [r24242]
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2011/q2/1090

  o We should also look into the dependencies of Nmap and Zenmap.  
    It may be instructive to look at "Portable Firefox"
    (http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable) which is
    built using open source technology from portableapps.com, or look at
    "The Network Toolkit" by Cace
    (http://www.cacetech.com/products/network_toolkit.html).

o --max-conns is broken in latest svn -> fixed in r24130, other two
  bugs discovered:
  o --max-conns 0 kills ncat with a glibc assertion error on calloc with
  zero as nmemb(??) at:
    init_fdlist(&broadcast_fdlist, o.conn_limit);
  o When killing the first initiated connection on --max-conns > 1 Ncat:
    Ncat: Program bug: fd (5) not on list. QUITTING.
  [DONE]The previous two bugs were introduced in r24130, they are now fixed
  in r24193.
