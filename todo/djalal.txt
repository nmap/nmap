1) Nmap Scripting Engine Infrastructure:

o NSE Version Numbering.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q4/693

[Other tasks]
o Propose a better duplicate scanned IPs filtering engine.


2) NSE Scripts:

[Priorities tasks]
o NFS/RPC features:
- add NFS READLINK support to let nfs-ls show symbolic files.

o Write new NSE libraries and scripts which can includes vulnerabilities
checks scripts.
Focus on the open source software vulnerabilities since there is another
google summer of code project which handles Microsoft softwares.
Select vulnerabilities form the oss-security mailing list.

o Review NSE scripts and libs, and fixing bugs:
 - Document all the new NFS procedures.

o Write an other script that uses a "prerule" or a "postrule".

[Other tasks]
o NFS/RPC features:
- Add more authentication support: Unix authentication.
- NFSv4 support.
- Add recursion support to nfs-ls.nse


==

MAYBE:

o Create a new rule "versionrule" which will be used by version
  category scripts.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q3/551

o NSE debugger.

o Add more NSE control for long running scripts: one option will be a
boolean expression filter (like: tcpdump) which will change NSE scripts
arguments or behaviour according to previous results, this will be
really useful for big networks. Another option will be a generic NSE
(Lua) script with an easy and readable code that includes expressions or
filters selection to let us change NSE arguments according to previous
results.
Note: this option will be useful on big networks. however for the moment
this is a simple idea and it needs further discussion on the nmap-dev.

o Privileges dropping for NSE scripts [nmap TODO list].

o NSE security review [nmap TODO list].


o Fixing bugs.
- NSE not honoring the source port flag when doing version scan.
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2010/q2/576
  
  David said that it will not be easy to support setting the source port

DONE:

1) Nmap Scripting Engine Infrastructure:

o Make NSE scripts able to retrieve the interface network
  information.
  
o LuaFileSystem directory iterator [1] port.
[1] http://keplerproject.github.com/luafilesystem/

o New class of scripts which use two new script rules:
 - Script Pre-scanning and Script Post-scanning rules: "prerule" and
   "postrule". Documented these new phases.
 - Update scripts to use these new rules:
   dns-zone-transfer now uses "prerule" and "portrule".

o Update other parts of Nmap book to show the new Script scan phases.

o Fixing bugs:
 - NSE not honoring the Exclude directive bug fixed and committed 
   as r18467.

o Let NSE "prerule", "portrule" and "hostrule" scripts to add new
discoverd targets to Nmap.

o Update scripting.xml to show the new script scan phases.

2) NSE Scripts:

o NFS/RPC features:
 - New script: nfs-ls which combines nfs-dirlist and nfs-acls and try to
   emulates some features of the old "ls" unix tool. The script support
   NFSv2 and NFSv3.
 - Readapted the RPC and NFS library code with a new re-design with new
   high level functions.
 - Added NFS procedures support:
   NFSv2: LOOKUP
   NFSv3: FSSTAT, FSINFO, READDIRPLUS, PATHCONF, ACCESS, LOOKUP
