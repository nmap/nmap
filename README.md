Installing
----------
Ideally, you should be able to just type:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

For far more in-depth compilation, installation, and removal notes, read the
[Nmap Install Guide](https://nmap.org/book/install.html) on Nmap.org.

Using Nmap
----------
Nmap has a lot of features, but getting started is as easy as running `nmap
scanme.nmap.org`. Running `nmap` without any parameters will give a helpful
list of the most common options, which are discussed in depth in [the man
page](https://nmap.org/book/man.html). Users who prefer a graphical interface
can use the included [Zenmap front-end](https://nmap.org/zenmap/).

Contributing
------------
Information about filing bug reports and contributing to the Nmap project can
