RadialNet 0.4
-------------

o Incorporated a HostsViewer class that lists the hosts in a left list and show
  its information in a NodeNotebook in the right side. It can be accessed in the
  new Tools button on toolbar.

o Added a complete OS Fingerprint and Sequences view with other general
  informations in the NodeNotebook class.

o Create a set of class to make more easy follow the Gnome HIG 2.0
  specifications and the creation of complex composed widgets. This set is
  called bestwidgets.

o Create a class and file named NodeNotebook and move node noetebook pages to
  it.

o Added a Application class to solve user interface issues like hide and show of
  widgets.

o Improve command line options with ArgvHandle class. And add a file chooser
  dialog to interface to open Nmap XML files from the GUI.

o Enable visualization of host with no traceroute information. These nodes are
  link to localhost and has black dashed connections. This make possible for
  non-privileged users use the RadialNet.

o Remove statusbar from node's window and put hostname in title.

o Added a new notebook to node's window with all traceroute information.

o By default latency numbers are hidden, ring gap is changed to 30 and fisheye
  spread factor to 0.5.

o Convert frames in control panel to expanders to grant to user see only he
  need.

o Move actions toolbar menu to right control panel. And a information button
  was added. They are placed in a "Action" expander.

RadialNet 0.31
--------------

o Improve the animation by coherent calculus of children positions. Using some
  angle conditions we can perform a better animation.

o Reduce excessive processing on some update methods that check values in
  RadialNet class periodically.


RadialNet 0.3

o New services viewer on pop-up windows. With NSE script output support with a
  text viewer.

o Added option to enable/disable slow-in/slow-out animation in options list.

o Fixes wrong English messages in the program (thanks to DePriest, Jasey).


RadialNet 0.2
-------------

o Improve icons apparency, size and position.

o Added latency mean for each edge as text and width of edge. The edge's width
  is normalized between 1 (min value) to 5 (max value) pixels.

o When a node is a group we draw a black circle if localhost (127.0.0.1) is
  grouped on it.

o Change mouse button events to a toolbar. The options. We include buttons to
  guide mouse actions. Three options are added, one to change the center of
  visualization, another to group node's children, and more one to fill node's
  draw region.

o Added region fill feature. When clicking in a node with this option the
  hierarchical region that a node use to draw its children is filled with a
  chosen color (red, yellow or green).

o Added different draw properties for unknown nodes and edges latencies. If a
  node is unknown we draw a white node with blue stroke, and if the edge latency
  is unknown we draw it dashed.

o Decrease draw complexity. Reducing the number of draw method and making the
  methods for draw node and edges more intelligent.

o Fixed division by zero error when number of frames is less than 3. This
  happens because the interpolation method need a number of pass great or equal
  to 3 (thanks to Hiroshi).
