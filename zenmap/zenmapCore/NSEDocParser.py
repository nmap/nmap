# * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software

# * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a

# *
# * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and

# * submissions as described in the Nmap Public Source License Contributor
# * Agreement. This is important because we fund the project by selling licenses
# * with various terms, and also because the inability to relicense code has
# * caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
