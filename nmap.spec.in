%description

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility
for network exploration or security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
both console and graphical versions are available.

%description -n ncat
Ncat is a feature packed networking utility which will read and
write data across a network from the command line.  It uses both
TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable
back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other
applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6
but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential
uses.

%description -n nping
Nping is an open source tool for network packet generation, response
analysis and response time measurement. Nping allows to generate network
packets of a wide range of protocols, letting users to tune virtually
any field of the protocol headers. While Nping can be used as a simple
ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet
generator for network stack stress tests, ARP poisoning, Denial of
Service attacks, route tracing, etc.
