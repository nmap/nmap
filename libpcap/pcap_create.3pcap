.SH NAME
pcap_create \- create a live capture handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.nf
.ft B
char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
.ft
.LP
.ft B
pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pcap_create ()
is used to create a packet capture handle to look
at packets on the network.
.I source
is a string that specifies the network device to open; on Linux systems
with 2.2 or later kernels, a
.I source
argument of "any" or
.B NULL
can be used to capture packets from all interfaces.
.I errbuf
is a buffer large enough to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.
.PP
The returned handle must be activated with
.BR pcap_activate (3PCAP)
before packets can be captured
with it; options for the capture, such as promiscuous mode, can be set
on the handle before activating it.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR pcap_create ()
returns a
.B pcap_t *
on success and
.B NULL
on failure.
If
.B NULL
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message.
