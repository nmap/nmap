.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pcap_findalldevs ()
constructs a list of network devices that can be opened with
.BR pcap_create (3PCAP)
and
.BR pcap_activate (3PCAP)
or with
.BR pcap_open_live (3PCAP).
(Note that there may be network devices that cannot be opened by the
process calling
.BR pcap_findalldevs (),
because, for example, that process does not have sufficient privileges
to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will not appear on the
list.)
.I alldevsp
is a pointer to a
.BR "pcap_if_t *" ;
.I errbuf
is a buffer large enough to hold at least
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
chars.
.PP
If
.BR pcap_findalldevs ()
succeeds, the pointer pointed to by
.I alldevsp
is set to point to the first element of the list, or to
.B NULL
if no devices were found (this is considered success).
Each element of the list is of type
.BR pcap_if_t ,
and has the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B next
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to the next element in the list;
.B NULL
for the last element of the list
.TP
.B name
a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to
.BR pcap_open_live ()
.TP
.B description
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a string giving a human-readable description of the device
.TP
.B addresses
a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the
device,
or
.B NULL
if the device has no addresses
.TP
.B flags
device flags:
.RS
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK
set if the device is a loopback interface
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_UP
set if the device is up
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_RUNNING
set if the device is running
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_WIRELESS
set if the device is a wireless interface; this includes IrDA as well as
radio-based networks such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, so it
doesn't just mean Wi-Fi
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS
a bitmask for an indication of whether the adapter is connected or not;
for wireless interfaces, "connected" means "associated with a network"
.TP
The possible values for the connection status bits are:
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN
it's unknown whether the adapter is connected or not
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED
the adapter is connected
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED
the adapter is disconnected
.TP
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE
the notion of "connected" and "disconnected" don't apply to this
interface; for example, it doesn't apply to a loopback device
.RE
.RE
.PP
Each element of the list of addresses is of type
.BR pcap_addr_t ,
and has the following members:
.RS
.TP
.B next
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to the next element in the list;
.B NULL
for the last element of the list
.TP
.B addr
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
containing an address
.TP
.B netmask
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to by
.B addr
.TP
.B broadaddr
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the broadcast address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
.BR addr ;
may be
.B NULL
if the device doesn't support broadcasts
.TP
.B dstaddr
if not
.BR NULL ,
a pointer to a
.B "struct sockaddr"
that contains the destination address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
.BR addr ;
may be
.B NULL
if the device isn't a point-to-point interface
.RE
.PP
Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so you must
check the
.B sa_family
member of the
.B "struct sockaddr"
before interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the
addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
IPv4 addresses have the value
.BR AF_INET ,
IPv6 addresses have the value
.B AF_INET6
(which older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not
define), and other addresses have other values.  Whether other addresses
are returned, and what types they might have is platform-dependent.
Namely, link-layer addresses, such as Ethernet MAC addresses, have the value
.B AF_PACKET
(on Linux) or
.B AF_LINK
(on AIX, FreeBSD, Haiku, illumos, macOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD) or are not
returned at all (on GNU/Hurd and Solaris).
.PP
For IPv4 addresses, the
.B "struct sockaddr"
pointer can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
.BR "struct sockaddr_in" ;
for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
.BR "struct sockaddr_in6".
For link-layer addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
.B "struct sockaddr_ll"
(for
.BR AF_PACKET )
or a
.B "struct sockaddr_dl"
(for
.BR AF_LINK ).
.PP
The list of devices must be freed with
.BR pcap_freealldevs (3PCAP),
which frees the list pointed to by
.IR alldevs .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR pcap_findalldevs ()
returns
.B 0
on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR
on failure; as indicated, finding no
devices is considered success, rather than failure, so
.B 0
will be
returned in that case. If
.B PCAP_ERROR
is returned,
.I errbuf
is filled in with an appropriate error message,
and the pointer pointed to by
.I alldevsp
is set to
.BR NULL .
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
.PP
The
.B PCAP_IF_UP
and
.B PCAP_IF_RUNNING
constants became available in libpcap release 1.6.1.  The
.BR PCAP_IF_WIRELESS ,
.BR PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS ,
.BR PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN ,
.BR PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED ,
.BR PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED ,
and
.B PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE
constants became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.
