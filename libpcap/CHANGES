Tuesday, February 25, 2003. fenner@research.att.com.  0.7.2 release

 	Support link types that use 802.2 always, never, and sometimes.

	pcap_stats() has been documented as to what its counters mean on
	each platform.

Tuesday January 9, 2001. guy@alum.mit.edu. Summary for 0.6 release

	New Linux libpcap implementation, which, in 2.2 and later
	kernels, uses PF_PACKET sockets and supports kernel packet
	filtering (if compiled into the kernel), and supports the "any"
	device for capturing on all interfaces.  Cleans up promiscuous
	mode better on pre-2.2 kernels, and has various other fixes
	(handles 2.4 ARPHRD_IEEE802_TR, handles ISDN devices better,
	doesn't show duplicate packets on loopback interface, etc.).

	Fixed HP-UX libpcap implementation to correctly get the PPA for
	an interface, to allow interfaces to be opened by interface name.

	libpcap savefiles have system-independent link-layer type values
	in the header, rather than sometimes platform-dependent DLT_
	values, to make it easier to exchange capture files between
	different OSes.

	Non-standard capture files produced by some Linux tcpdumps, e.g.
	the one from Red Hat Linux 6.2 and later, can now be read.

	Updated autoconf stock files.

	Filter expressions can filter on VLAN IDs and various OSI
	protocols, and work on Token Ring (with non-source-routed
	packets).

	"pcap_open_dead()" added to allow compiling filter expressions
	to pcap code without opening a capture device or capture file.

	Header files fixed to allow use in C++ programs.

	Removed dependancy on native headers for packet layout.
	Removed Linux specific headers that were shipped.

	Security fixes: Strcpy replaced with strlcpy, sprintf replaced
	with snprintf.

	Fixed bug that could cause subsequent "pcap_compile()"s to fail
	erroneously after one compile failed.

	Assorted other bug fixes.

	README.aix and README.linux files added to describe
	platform-specific issues.

	"getifaddrs()" rather than SIOCGIFCONF used, if available.

v0.5 Sat Jun 10 11:09:15 PDT 2000

itojun@iijlab.net
- Brought in KAME IPv6/IPsec bpf compiler.
- Fixes for NetBSD.
- Support added for OpenBSD DLT_LOOP and BSD/OS DLT_C_HDLC (Cisco HDLC),
  and changes to work around different BSDs having different DLT_ types
  with the same numeric value.

Assar Westerlund  <assar@sics.se>
- Building outside the source code tree fixed.
- Changed to write out time stamps with 32-bit seconds and microseconds
  fields, regardless of whether those fields are 32 bits or 64 bits in
  the OS's native "struct timeval".
- Changed "pcap_lookupdev()" to dynamically grow the buffer into which
  the list of interfaces is read as necessary in order to hold the
  entire list.

Greg Troxel <gdt@ir.bbn.com>
- Added a new "pcap_compile_nopcap()", which lets you compile a filter
  expression into a BPF program without having an open live capture or
  capture file.

- Fix endian problem with DLT_NULL devices. From FreeBSD via Bill
  Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

  bug report by barnett@grymoire.crd.ge.com (Bruce Barnett). Also added
  options to disable gcc and to force a particular packet capture type.

- Added support for Fore ATM interfaces (qaa and fa) under IRIX. Thanks
  to John Hawkinson (jhawk@mit.edu)

- Change Linux PPP and SLIP to use DLT_RAW since the kernel does not
  supply any "link layer" data.

- Change Linux to use SIOCGIFHWADDR ioctl to determine link layer type.
  Thanks to Thomas Sailer (sailer@ife.ee.ethz.ch)

- Change IRIX PPP to use DLT_RAW since the kernel does not supply any
  "link layer" data.

  formats.

- Added some new SGI snoop interface types. Thanks to Steve Alexander
  (sca@refugee.engr.sgi.com)

  Richard Allen (ra@hp.is) and Steinar Haug (sthaug@nethelp.no)

- Fddi supports broadcast as reported by Jeff Macdonald
  (jeff@iacnet.com). Also correct ieee802 and arcnet.

  Reported reported by Eric Jacksch (jacksch@tenebris.ca)

- Fixed bug in pcap_dispatch() that kept it from returning on packet
  timeouts.

- Changed ISLOOPBACK() macro when IFF_LOOPBACK isn't available to check
  for "lo" followed by an eos or digit (newer versions of Linux
  apparently call the loopback "lo" instead of "lo0").

- Fixed Linux networking include files to use ints instead of longs to
  avoid problems with 64 bit longs on the alpha. Thanks to Cristian
  Gafton (gafton@redhat.com)

  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

  wasn't being initialized sometimes resulting in an "NIOCSFLAGS:
  Invalid argument" error under OSF/1. Reported by Matt Day
  (mday@artisoft.com) and Danny Mitzel (dmitzel@whitney.hitc.com).

- Turn on FDDI support by default.
