 * distinguish between them.
 *
 * In 3.0 and later kernels, if there's a VLAN tag present, the tp_vlan_tci

 *
 * With a pre-3.0 kernel, we cannot distinguish between packets with no
 * VLAN tag and packets on VLAN 0, so we will mishandle some packets, and
 * there's nothing we can do about that.
 *
 * So, on those systems, which never set the TP_STATUS_VLAN_VALID flag, we
 * continue the behavior of earlier libpcaps, wherein we treated packets
 * with a VLAN tag of 0 as being packets without a VLAN tag rather than packets
 * on VLAN 0.  We do this by treating packets with a tp_vlan_tci of 0 and
 * with the TP_STATUS_VLAN_VALID flag not set in tp_status as not having
 * VLAN tags.  This does the right thing on 3.0 and later kernels, and
 * continues the old unfixably-imperfect behavior on pre-3.0 kernels.

 *
 * On Fedora 9, with a 2.6.26.3-29 kernel, my Zydas stick, at
 * least, has a "wmaster0" device and a "wlan0" device; the
 * latter is the one with the IP address.  Both show up in
 * "tcpdump -D" output.  Capturing on the wmaster0 device
 * captures with 802.11 headers.
 *
 * airmon-ng searches through /sys/class/net for devices named
 * monN, starting with mon0; as soon as one *doesn't* exist,
 * it chooses that as the monitor device name.  If the "iw"
 * command exists, it does
 *
 *    iw dev {if_name} interface add {monif_name} type monitor
 *
 * where {monif_name} is the monitor device.  It then (sigh) sleeps
 * .1 second, and then configures the device up.  Otherwise, if
 * /sys/class/ieee80211/{phydev_name}/add_iface is a file, it writes
 * {mondev_name}, without a newline, to that file, and again (sigh)
 * sleeps .1 second, and then iwconfig's that device into monitor
 * mode and configures it up.  Otherwise, you can't do monitor mode.
 *
 * All these devices are "glued" together by having the
 * /sys/class/net/{if_name}/phy80211 links pointing to the same
 * place, so, given a wmaster, wlan, or mon device, you can
 * find the other devices by looking for devices with
 * the same phy80211 link.
 *
 * To turn monitor mode off, delete the monitor interface,
 * either with
 *
 *    iw dev {monif_name} interface del
 *
 * or by sending {monif_name}, with no NL, down
 * /sys/class/ieee80211/{phydev_name}/remove_iface
 *
 * Note: if you try to create a monitor device named "monN", and
 * there's already a "monN" device, it fails, as least with
 * the netlink interface (which is what iw uses), with a return
 * value of -ENFILE.  (Return values are negative errnos.)  We

	 * recent - that feature was introduced in Linux 4.6.
	 *
	 * AF_UNIX will work *if* you have UNIX-domain sockets configured
	 * into the kernel and *if* you're not on a system that doesn't
	 * allow them - some SELinux systems don't allow you create them.
	 * Most systems probably have them configured in, but not all systems
	 * have them configured in and allow them to be created.
	 *
	 * AF_INET will work *if* you have IPv4 configured into the kernel,
	 * but, apparently, some systems have network adapters but have
	 * kernels without IPv4 support.
	 *
	 * AF_INET6 will work *if* you have IPv6 configured into the
	 * kernel, but if you don't have AF_INET, you might not have
	 * AF_INET6, either (that is, independently on its own grounds).
	 *
	 * AF_PACKET would work, except that some of these calls should
	 * work even if you *don't* have capture permission (you should be
	 * able to enumerate interfaces and get information about them
	 * without capture permission; you shouldn't get a failure until
	 * you try pcap_activate()).  (If you don't allow programs to
	 * get as much information as possible about interfaces if you
	 * don't have permission to capture, you run the risk of users

		 *
		 *	https://www.mail-archive.com/tcpdump-workers@sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/msg01043.html
		 *
		 * and one was assigned.
		 *
		 * In a later private discussion (spun off from a message
		 * on the ethereal-users list) on how to get that DLT_
		 * value in libpcap on Linux, I ended up deciding that
		 * the best thing to do would be to have him tweak the
		 * driver to set the ARPHRD_ value to some ARPHRD_FCxx
		 * type, and map all those types to DLT_IP_OVER_FC:
		 *
		 *	I've checked into the libpcap and tcpdump CVS tree
		 *	support for DLT_IP_OVER_FC.  In order to use that,
		 *	you'd have to modify your modified driver to return
		 *	one of the ARPHRD_FCxxx types, in "fcLINUXfcp.c" -
		 *	change it to set "dev->type" to ARPHRD_FCFABRIC, for
		 *	example (the exact value doesn't matter, it can be
		 *	any of ARPHRD_FCPP, ARPHRD_FCAL, ARPHRD_FCPL, or
		 *	ARPHRD_FCFABRIC).
		 *
		 * 11 years later, Christian Svensson wanted to map
		 * various ARPHRD_ values to DLT_FC_2 and
		 * DLT_FC_2_WITH_FRAME_DELIMS for raw Fibre Channel
		 * frames:
		 *
		 *	https://github.com/mcr/libpcap/pull/29
		 *
		 * There doesn't seem to be any network drivers that uses
		 * any of the ARPHRD_FC* values for IP-over-FC, and
		 * it's not exactly clear what the "Dummy types for non
		 * ARP hardware" are supposed to mean (link-layer
		 * header type?  Physical network type?), so it's
		 * not exactly clear why the ARPHRD_FC* types exist
		 * in the first place.
		 *
		 * For now, we map them to DLT_FC_2, and provide an
		 * option of DLT_FC_2_WITH_FRAME_DELIMS, as well as
		 * DLT_IP_OVER_FC just in case there's some old
		 * driver out there that uses one of those types for
		 * IP-over-FC on which somebody wants to capture
