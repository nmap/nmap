.TH PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION 3PCAP "23 August 2018"
.SH NAME
pcap_set_tstamp_precision \- set the time stamp precision returned in
captures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pcap_set_tstamp_precision ()
sets the precision of the time stamp desired for packets captured on the pcap
descriptor to the type specified by
.IR tstamp_precision .
It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
.BR pcap_create (3PCAP)
that has not yet been activated by
.BR pcap_activate (3PCAP).
Two time stamp precisions are supported, microseconds and nanoseconds. One can
use options
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO
and
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
to request desired precision. By default, time stamps are in microseconds.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR pcap_set_tstamp_precision ()
returns
.B 0
on success if the specified time stamp precision is expected to be
supported by the capture device,
.B PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP
if the capture device does not support the requested time stamp
precision,
.B PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been activated.
.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.1.  In previous
releases, time stamps from a capture device or savefile are always given
in seconds and microseconds.
