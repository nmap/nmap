 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software

 * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.

 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and
 * add new features. You are highly encouraged to submit your changes as a

 * caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
