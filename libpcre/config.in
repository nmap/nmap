/* On Unix systems config.in is converted by configure into config.h. PCRE is
written in Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope
with, allowing it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.

On a non-Unix system you should just copy this file into config.h, and set up
the macros the way you need them. You should normally change the definitions of
HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE to 1. Unfortunately, because of the way autoconf
works, these cannot be made the defaults. If your system has bcopy() and not
memmove(), change the definition of HAVE_BCOPY instead of HAVE_MEMMOVE. If your
system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), leave them both as 0; an emulation
function will be used. */

can't make this the default because "configure" files generated by autoconf
will only change 0 to 1; they won't change 1 to 0 if the functions are not
found. */

the stack, because this is faster than using malloc() for each call. The
