IBM Z mainframes starting from version z13 provide vector instructions, which 
allows vectorization of crc32. This extension is build by default when targeting
ibm s390x. However this extension can disabled if desired:

    # for configure build
    $ ./configure --disable-crcvx

    # for cmake build
    $ cmake .. -DZLIB_CRC32VX=off
