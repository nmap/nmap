This is Dug Song's excellent Libdnet networking library version 1.18.
It has been stripped down for inclusion within Nmap and modified as follows:

o Removed the following directories:
  python, test, man

o Removed the fw-* files except for fw-none because Nmap doesn't use
  the firewall API.  Changed configure.in to always use fw-none.

o Removed files in now-removed dirs that were referenced in the AC_OUTPUT
  at the end of configure.ac

o Ran "aclocal -I . -I config" to regenerate aclocal.m4 with the same version of
  aclocal that is used with the rest of Nmap

o Added this NMAP_MODIFICATIONS file.

o Regenerated build files with Autoconf 2.69, Automake 1.16.5, and
  libtool 2.4.6.

Other changes documented as commits.
