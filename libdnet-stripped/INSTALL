*BSD, MacOS X, Linux
--------------------

./configure && make

Solaris, IRIX, BSD/OS, HP-UX, Tru64
-----------------------------------

For firewall support, install Darren Reed's IP Filter package:

	http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/

For tunnel support on Solaris, install the Universal TUN/TAP Driver:

	http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/

Unixware, AIX
-------------

These ports are incomplete. If anyone can set me up with legitimate
root access to these platforms, it would be most appreciated. :-)

Windows 2000/XP
---------------

For raw Ethernet sending, install the WinPcap driver and DLLs, and
extract their developer pack to a build directory:

	http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm

# XXX - unsupported for now
# For tunnel interface support, install the OpenVPN "TAP-Win32 Virtual
# Ethernet Adapter" component (their Windows installer will let you
# install it alone):
#
#	http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/

For firewall support, install HSC's PktFilter service:

	http://www.hsc.fr/ressources/outils/pktfilter/index.html.en

Most Windows developers should just use the libdnet developer's pack
(with MinGW and MSVC++ libraries) instead of building it themselves.
But for those who really want to know...

To build a MinGW native library (under Cygwin+MinGW):

	./configure && make

To build a Microsoft Visual C++ native library and Python module
(again, under Cygwin+MinGW):

	./configure
	cd python && C:/Python23/python.exe setup.py build
	cd ../src && lib /out:dnet.lib *.obj
