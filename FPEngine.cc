   This can be thought of as the distance from the given feature vector to the

   further scaled by the inverse of the sample variance of that feature. This is
   an approximation of the Mahalanobis distance
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance), which normally uses a
   full covariance matrix of the features. If we take the features to be
   pairwise independent (which they are not), then the covariance matrix is just
   the diagonal matrix containing per-feature variances, leading to the same
   calculation as is done below. Using only the per-feature variances rather
   than covariance matrices is to save space; it requires only n entries per
   class rather than n^2, where n is the length of a feature vector.

   It happens often that a feature's variance is undefined (because there is
   only one example in the class) or zero (because there are two identical
   values for that feature). Both these cases are mapped to zero by train.py,
   and we handle them the same way: by using a small default variance. This will
   tend to make small differences count a lot (because we probably want this
   fingerprint in order to expand the class), while still allowing near-perfect
   matches to match. */
