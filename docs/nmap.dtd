    This is the DTD for Nmap's XML output (-oX) format.

    Now maintained by Fyodor <fyodor@insecure.org> as part of Nmap.     

    To validate using this file, simply add a DOCTYPE line similar to:
    <!DOCTYPE nmaprun SYSTEM "nmap.dtd">
    to the nmap output immediately below the prologue (the first line).  This
    should allow you to run a validating parser against the output (so long
    as the DTD is in your parser's DTD search path).

    Bugs:
    Most of the elements are "locked" into the specific order that nmap
    generates, when there really is no need for a specific ordering.
    This is primarily because I don't know the xml DTD construct to
    specify "one each of this list of elements, in any order".  If there
    is a construct similar to SGML's '&' operator, please let me know.
