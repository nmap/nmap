TODO $Id: TODO 11866 2009-01-24 23:10:05Z fyodor $ -*-text-*-

o Build x86 VM instance for RPM building. [Fyodor]

o Look into building RPMs with SSL support. Statically linking to
  OpenSSL on Linux for the RPMs didn't work for me last time I
  tried. [Fyodor]

o Device categorization improvements
  o Examine Nmap's device categorization in nmap-os-deb and
    nmap-service-probes.  Decide if some small categories which have
    never really took off should be consolidated, or whether others
    should be split off.  For example, maybe there are some groups in
    'specialized' or other misc. categories which are now large enough
    to split off.  Personally, I wouldn't give anything its own
    category unless there are at least half a dozen of them and no
    other category really fits them well.  We should use a combined
    system for nmap-os-db and nmap-service-probes.
  o Add a classification sect1 to os-detection.xml
    (http://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html) to cover how Nmap handles OS
    classification.  It should include a list with descriptions of
    each device type recognized by Nmap.  Version-detection.xml should
    reference (link to) it in the approprate place.
    [Doug has done some initial work on this.  For example, see
     nmap/docs/device-types.txt]

o Consider making the ping scan default be more comprehensive.  Note
  that I got 23% more Internet boxes found out of a 50K sample (see host
  enumeration chapter of my book for details).  Maybe I should
  experiment a bit more to ensure they are real boxes and not network
  artifacts and figure out exactly which tests are helping the most.
  If I do this change, I'll have to update the host enumeration
  chapter.  For UDP probing purposes, we should test whether including
  extra data in the packet (e.g. --data-length) helps in general, and
  for services such as 53 and 137, we should probably send proper
  protocol headers (e.g. a DNS server status message) so that we
  receive responses from listening services.

o Once we're done with host discovery empirical research, add it to
  host-discovery.xml.  Would be great to show the best combinations to
  use for a given number of probes, the efficiency of the common probes
  by themselves, etc.

o Add version detection signiture for Ncat chat once we finalize the
  announce format.

o [NSE] Make it a warning rather than error if a script in script.db
   can't be found. [Patrick]

o [NSE] Correct nsock_connect to unlock the socket slot if the
  connection fails.  When a socket is closed, it is unlocked so the
  arbitrator can potentially open up a socket for another thread. But
  Patrick discovered that a socket is not automatically unlocked when
  a connection fails or times out, only when it is closed
  explicitly. So that could hold up socket allocation for other
  threads until garbage collection.  May be a cause of slowness or
  possibly deadlocks. [Patrick]

o [NSE] Solve segfault issue which occurs when Nsock events call back
  on a thread that has already ended (e.g. timeout, crash, early exit,
  whatever) and been garbage collected.  May want to just nsi_delete
  all nsock sockets immediately upon thread ending.  For an example of
  this type of segfault, see
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0289.html. David says " I think
  in the interests of getting this in a stable release, we should use
  that strategy of closing all a thread's sockets. That ought to fix
  all the problems above.  Not to rule out a more thoughtful redesign
  in the future." [David,Patrick]

o Deal with Ncat newline problem.  See this thread:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0325.html

o For at least our UDP ping probes, Nmap should probably notice if it
  is a very well known service port such as 53, 161, or 137 and send
  an appropriate probe packet (server status for DNS, public community
  string query for SNMP, etc) rather than empty data in that case.
  This is similar to the way our IP protocol probes automatically
  include common headers such as TCP and UDP if that common protocol
  is given.  Good probes for these services are already available in
  nmap-service-probes, though we might want to make a custom file for
  this.  We should probably do this for port scanning as well.

o [Ncat] In verbose mode, print when an SSL connection is established
  successfully and give the leaf certificate hash to make it easier to
  verify when connecting to a machine where you can't or don't want to
  use --ssl-verify (e.g. connecting to an ncat ssl server where it
  created its own key).  While we're at it, we might want to print
  some other information from the leaf node, such as organizationName
  and maybe localityName, countryName or something.  We don't want to
  be too verbose, but 1 line would be great and 2-3 might be
  acceptable.

o We added the SEQ.CI value in Feb 2009 with 0 matchpoints.  At some
  point (once we have some real-life values) we need to evaluate whether
  we want to give it points.  A good time to do that would be when we
  next do fingerprint integration, so we will actually have examples
  of .CI in the nmap-os-db. [David]

o [NSE] Get rid of ceil so that floating point NSE runlevels work
  again (some scripts, including (smb-brute) rely on this.  They got
  broken with the NSE core lua rewrite. [David,Patrick].

o NSE script logical operator stuff is now documented in
  scripting.xml--add to refguide.xml as well. [David/Patrick]

===FEATURES FOR NEXT STABLE VERSION GO ABOVE THIS POINT===

o We should probably check for a system Lua in a "lua5.1" directory
  rather than just "lua", as Debian and also my Fedora 10 systems seem
  to have that.  See
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=527997. [Note,
  Fyodor asked the bug reporter Jan Nordholz on 5/14/09 if he could
  write a patch]

o [Ncat] In verbose mode, I'd like to see clock time and maybe in/out
  traffic stats when a client connection ends.  Maybe it could use a
  format similar to what Nmap provides.

o Scanning through proxies
 o Nmap should be able to scan through proxy servers, particularly now
   that we have an NSE script for detectiong open proxies and now that
   Ncat can act as proxy client or server.
 o Requirements:
   o Should be able to chain through multiple proxy servers of different
     types
   o Support IPv4 and v6
   o Need to figure out how to get good performance.  Pool of
     connections to proxy or proxies for concurrency?  HTTP pipelining?
   o Support the different varieties of proxies: socks4, socks4a,
     socks5, HTTP GET (if possible), HTTP CONNECT.  Note that GET
     proxies present some challenges since the error messages may not
     be standard, etc.
   o Maybe auto-detect the proxy type so that Nmap can try the most
     efficient scanning method first?
 o Implementation ideas: 
   o There is a patch by Zoltan Panczel (http://nmap-dev.fw.hu) and it
     has been improved by Jacob Appelbaum in nmap-exp/ioerror/ .  This
     patch doesn't handle things like parallelization, but it may be a
     great proof of concept.
   o This might not be appropriate for ultra_scan ... perhaps would be
     better to write a general scanning engine for abusing
     applications for port scanning purposes.  This could handle
     scanning through proxies and the existing FTP bounce scan would
     also be ported to this engine.  rembrandt at jpberlin.de tells me
     that you can also do this with the "forwarding" commands on IMAP
     servers.  Whoever does this should probably start by reading the
     code for the main port scanning engine (ultra_scan()) and also
     the version detection code (service_scan()).  And the version
     detection paper at http://nmap.org/book/vscan.html.  If you
     understand all that, you may be ready for this project :).  This
     is important, because it is easy to do poorly.  The tough part is
     high performance and clean code which is general enough that all
     these different applications can be scanned through using the
     same basic engine.  You should run your ideas by nmap-dev in as
     much detail as possible before starting.

o [NSE] Optimize NSE Performance--e.g. measure the current performance and
  see what can be improved in terms of scheduling scan threads,
  determining how many to run concurrently, looking at CPU load items,
  etc.

o [NSE] Consider whether we should include some sort of NSE debugger.  Or we
  could include something simpler.  For example, some developers (such
  as Ron) already make use of Patrick's traceback.nse in their
  experimental trees.  For some inspiration/ideas, look at Diman's NSE
  debugger (http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0228.html) and also
  Patrick's traceback.nse 

o Add Nmap web board.
 
o Create Nmap wiki

o [NSE] Figure out what to do about NSE mutexes:
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0276.html . In particular, they
  are not currently cleaned up if a thread dies or otherwise exits
  without unlocking them and can cause endless deadlocks which are
  annoying to users and can be difficult to debug :(.  Patrick has
  some ideas for this in his SoC09 proposal:
   "Adding a cleanup system for NSE that is called periodically
    similar to nsock_loop. There would be a registration system
    allowing C libraries to register a Lua function that will run
    periodically to check for irresolvable deadlock or simply dead
    resources. For example, the nmap library would register a mutex
    cleanup handler which would inspect all mutexes looking for a dead
    thread or circular dependencies. The nsock library could register
    a handler that checks for unused sockets. The nsock may save a
    strong reference to the thread that owns the socket and inspect it
    to determine if the thread is dead."
  David later says: "After some discussion we decided to start more
  modestly, first by ensuring that a scripts mutexes are released when
  it dies for whatever reason. I have a hunch that this is the cause
  of most deadlocks. It was certainly the cause of two whois.nse
  deadlocks I found. Then, the next step if deadlocks continue to be a
  problem, is to do automatic detection and just print out a list of
  what scripts are involved. It could be that several smb scripts are
  deadlocked, or as in the case I observed where whois.nse was locked
  with itself."

o [NSE] Consider whether we need script.db for performance reasons at
  all or should just read through all the scripts and parse on the fly.
  See: [http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0221.html]

o [NSE] We may want to consider a better exception handling method --
  one which doesn't require wrapping every I/O line in its own try
  function call.  David says "Lua has an internal "exception handling"
  mechanism based on a function called pcall, which is implemented
  with setjmp/longjmp.  You can wrap a function call in it and the
  function will return there whenever there's an unhandled error.
  Something based on that would be better [than the current system], I
  think."

o [NSE] Open proxy detection script
  o We have http-open-proxy.nse, but we should probably either extrand
  that to handle other types of proxies (such as SOCKS and HTTP
  CONNECT) or create more scripts to handle those other proxy types.

o [NSE] Make sure all our HTTP scripts transparently support SSL
  servers too.

o [NSE] Make NSE work better for SSL tunneled services in general by
  supporting them easily in the libraries.  For example, I don't think
  irc-info.nse currently works against all the servers which tunnel
  over SSL.  Maybe augment comm library, etc.

o [NSE] http improvements
 o Spidering library+scripts?  How should the spider store the results
   and make them available to other scripts?  How do we limit
   bandwidth consumption and total amount of data stored?  Might want
   to look at enumeration script at
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0889.html
 o URL grinder checks for existence of applications in common/default
   paths. Scanning http paths to see if they exist is in some ways
   similar to scanning to see which ports are open.
 o Cookie suppport?  Might be useful for spidering sites which use it
   for authentication/authorization/personalization.
 o HTTP keepalive? May make spidering/grinding/auth cracking more efficient
 o Pipeliing? May make spidering/grinding/auth cracking more efficient
 o Consider POST/HEAD support. See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0889.html.

o [NSE] Improve username/password library (the database files
  themselves).  We don't have very good lists at the moment.  Maybe
  work in combination with Ncrack dev.

o [NSE] High speed brute force HTTP authentication.  Possibly POST and
   GET/HEAD brute force cracking.

o [NSE] BasicHTML/XML parser?  For example, Sven Klemm wrote a script
  which uses libxml2: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0462.html

o [NSE] Would be great if NSE scripts could be made to NOT
  run as root if they don't have to.

o [NSE] NFS query script for checking exports, etc.?

o [NSE] Web application fingerprinting script.  Would be great to be
  able to take a URL and determine things like "this is Joomla" or
  "this is Plone" or "Mediawiki" or whatever. Rather than hard code
  regular expressions or other tests in a script, it should use a
  signature file like Nmap OS and version detection do.  Might work in
  combination with URL grinder to check for applications at
  default/common locations. See also a script that does favicon
  scanning TODO item.

o [NSE] Figure out a way to support people who want to do script scan,
  but not port scan or ping scan.  One option would be to allow
  --script to list scan (-sL), but perhaps a better option is to
  provide a way to disable port scanning in the same way as we offer
  -PN to disable ping scanning.  As an example of this need, David had
  to write special code to avoid ping/port scanning when doing a
  whois.nse survey for
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/EffectivenessOfPingProbes.  The
  key for this task is to figure out how to do it from a user
  interface perspective and then implement and document it.  We've
  already been going in the direction of allowing script scanning in
  more types of scans--a while back we started allowing it with -sP
  ping scans due to high demand.

o Finish (or write new) favicon fingerprinting script. See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0583.html .  May need to do
  some more scanning and increase the DB size a bit.  May or may not
  want to combine this as part of a larger webapp fingerprinting
  script.

o NSE Security Review
 o Consider what, if any, vulnerabilities or security risks NSE has
   with respect to buffer overflows, format string bugs, any other
   maliciously formatted responses from target systems, etc.  Maybe
   address the known risk of malicious scripts too.
 o Consider that NSE runs scripts as root

o Ncat SSLv2 issues.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0319.html.  A big part of it is
  done, which was enhanced version detection probes to detect more SSL
  servers, The defect that remains is that Nsock can't connect to a
  small fraction of servers (including some of the ones detected by
  the new version probe). They are the servers that do only SSLv3 or
  TLSv1 and don't respond to a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello.  Even
  though most servers don't support SSLv2, they usually respond to the
  ClientHello and just don't offer any SSLv2 features.

o Integrate SCTP scanning support.  See Daniel Roethlisberger's branch
  in nmap-exp/daniel/nmap-sctp.  As of 4/30/09, he is nearing
  completion.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q2/0270.html.

o Consider whether to let Zenmap Topology graph export the images to
  svg/png/etc.  Also think about printing.  Note that João Medeiros
  has written a Umit patch to do this:
  http://trac.umitproject.org/ticket/316.

o Look at etc/payloads.conf in unicornscan-0.4.7 and see if they have
  any which we don't have, but should, for our version detection.
  They have a decent collection there.

o Figure out and document (in at least the Ncat user's guide) the best
  way to use Ncat for chaining through proxies.  One option is this
  sort of thing:
  ncat -l localhost 1234 --sh-exec "ncat --proxy A.A.A.A B.B.B.B"
  ncat --proxy localhost:1234 C.C.C.C
  If you had two proxies A.A.A.A and B.B.B.B, connecting to C.C.C.C.
  With another listener/--sh-exec pair for each additional proxy.
  But perhaps we can make it easier by adding it to the syntax.

o Consider converting this file to emacs org-mode
  (http://orgmode.org/) format. [Fyodor]
  o That format is still plain text and can be read/edited by vi
    users, etc.

o [Zenmap] The Search dialogue is helpful for finding a certain scan
  you've performed recently, but we should probably also offer a similar
  function for searching for certain applications/hosts within a scan
  (e.g. find all the hosts running Apache).  This new functionality
  might be a find option or some other mechanism rather than being
  part of the Search dialogue proper.

o [Zenmap] More complete implementation of ZenmapCommandLine/profile
  editor improvement ideas. See
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/ZenmapCommandLine. [David]

o Look into whether we should loosen/change the global congestion
  control system to address possible cases of one target host with many
  dropped packets slowing down the whole group.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html .
  * Related possibility: Fix --nogcc to gracefully handle ping scans.
    Right now it seems to go WAY TOO FAST (e.g. several thousand
    packets per second on my DSL line).

o [nsock] Fix Makefile to handle dependencies correctly (if that turns
  out to be the problem).  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0629.html.
  o Or it may be related to SVN timestampling.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0632.html.

o We should document an official way to compile/test refguide.xml so
  people can more easily test their changes to it.  This will probably
  involve moving legal-notices.xml into /nmap/docs, among other
  things.

o Make Zenmap settings get upgraded when the Zenmap executable is
  upgraded. The per-user configuration files such as scan_profile.usp
  and zenmap.conf are never overwritten once installed by Zenmap, so
  changes and fixes to those files don't reach anyone who has
  installed Zenmap already. This is most noticeable with changes to
  profiles and highlight definitions are notably affected. This fix
  may involve hard-coding settings that are not normally configured by
  users (like highlighting) or updating the per-user files at startup
  (only those parts that haven't been changed by the user).

o Look into memory consumption of UDP scans with -p- and large
  hostgroups.  See if there is a way to prevent them from eating up gigs
  of RAM.

o Start project to make Nmap a Featured Article on Wikipedia.

o Consider rethinking Nmap's -s* syntax for specifing scan types
  o Current problems with this -s syntax:
    o We already use like 20 of the 26 letters, so we end up with
      things like SCTP scan using -sY
    o Can make Nmap command lines hard to read, particularly given
      that we often need to improvise to find a letter which isn't
      taken.
    o Problematic for scan types -sI and -b which require arguments
    o Inconsistencies.  For example, -sC and -sV do script scan and
    version detection, respectively, and yet for OS detection we use
    -sO.
  o Possible solution:
    o We might want to just give them normal option strings, so you
      could do --maimon instead of -sM, for example.  For extremely
      common options such as SYN scan, UDP scan, version detection, we
      could perhaps find good single letter options as an alias to the
      longer one.
    o Another idea is to use something like --scantype syn,udp,sctp,
      which is a lot longer for single-type scans, but shorter when
      you're combining mulitiple ones.  Doesn't allow for individual
      scan arguments easily.  I (Fyodor) think I prefer the idea above
      of just givem them top level arguments.
  o Obviously this will take some discussion/brainstorming on nmap-dev.

o libnmap organization for UNIX and Windows
  o Then change Nmap and Zenmap to simply call this library

o Perhaps --traceroute should set currenths->distance because right
  now, I do an -O scan against scanme.nmap.org, and it does not figure
  out the distance.  So the fingerprint shows no distance element and
  Nmap doesn't print "Network Distance" in the results line.  That may
  be OK (Nmap probably isn't receiving the probe response needed for
  this, and maybe doesn't want to print the TG), but even when I do
  --traceroute I get no distance printed.  Yet Nmap clearly knows the
  distance since the traceroute shows all the hops up to and including
  the target (scanme.nmap.org).

o Improve the "run Zenmap as root" menu item to work on distributions
  without su-to-root.  We might even want to improve Zenmap so that it
  itself does not have to run as root, and just executes Nmap that
  way.  Rather than not showing Zenmap as root on the Menu of
  non-working systems, it might be better to have it but let it give
  an error message (and then, perhaps, run as nonroot) so that users
  of those distributions are more likely to contribute a fix.  We also
  might want to look at how the distributions themselves package Zenmap.

o Consider enhancing the new OS Assist system to handle version
  detection too. [SOC task?]

o Do -p- Internet UDP scans.

o Look a bit more at default version detection timing.  Particularly
  deciding the number of probes to run in parallel.

o Deal with UDP retransmission for version detection ( I think I
  should just do a second run of all probes for UDP if it fails to
  match anything).  The advantage there is that no retransmissions are
  neccessary if the service is found.  Then again, per-probe
  retransmission would let us redo the most likely probes (the one(s)
  that match the port number) quickly.  Lost packets should probably
  affect ideal_parallelism.

o Figure out why I [Fyodor] get a bunch of "Operation not permitted" errors
when I launch a scan on SYN such as: 
   /home/fyodor/nmap-exp/fyodor-perf/nmap -nogcc -T4 -n -v -p- --portpingfreq 250 -oA /home/fyodor/nmap-misc/logs/WorldScan/portpingfreq/logs/portpingfreq-250-1%T-%D 67.15.236.34 67.15.236.36 81.174.236.66 81.174.236.119 170.140.20.160 170.140.20.174 202.138.180.9 202.138.180.17 202.138.180.132 209.20.64.112
   The errors look like:
sendto in send_ip_packet: sendto(7, packet, 44, 0, 170.140.20.174, 16) => Operation not permitted
Offending packet: TCP 64.13.134.4:59820 > 170.140.20.174:59120 S ttl=39 id=19927 iplen=44  seq=2425535549 win=4096 <mss 1460>

   May be related to connection tracking and high scan rates. See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q4/0652.html
   http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq26
   Others have reported similar issues even without connection tracking.  See
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/0277.html
   http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2007/q2/0292.html

o Get better password data for unpw/ncrack
  o perhaps from Solar Designer.
  o perhaps add phpbb hack data (there is at least a list of 28,635
    passwords in phpbb_users.sql, and possibly more in other files.

o Nmaprc-related - Create a system to store Nmap defaults/preferences
  in an nmaprc file.
  o nmaprc should be in ~/.nmap on UNIX
  o On Windows, we may need a registry key to find the .nmaprc
  o Obtain Nmap data directory information from nmaprc at runtime rather than
    compiled in -- among other advantages this is needed to make
    relocateable rpm.
  o Make RPM relocatable (requires somehow avoiding storing paths in the
    binary)
  o Perhaps Lua could be used as the format?
  o .nmaprc for keeping defaults, etc.
    o Nmaprc infrastructure, hook to new timing variables
    o Nmaprc man page
    o Default timing mode
    o Default NSE arguments, such as user agent
    o Maybe Default source IP (-S) argument
    o should be a way to specify your own .nmaprc
    o Maybe lets you add a directory and template for saving all
     scans. 

o Search for nmap on google news, on google web, and add appropriate
  links to press page and the like.

o Nping -- like hping3 but uses Nmap infrastructure and to a
  large degree the same command-line options as Nmap.

o Website: Create shr (shared) directory in svn, which will contain
  directories shared between the Insecure.org network of sites
  (e.g. templates, error, css).  Then sites such as sectools,
  nmap.org, insecure.org can just check that out via externals
  declaration (or, I suppose, symlink).  CSS directives will then use
  /shr/css/insecdb.css etc. ). [Fyodor]

o Zenmap script selection interface for deciding which NSE scripts to
  run.

o Get new Zenmap logo
 o consider putting back on top-right of command constructor wizard
 (there used to be umit logo there).
 o Maybe that can be done after the release by soliciting ideas.

o Make Zenmap splash screen

o nmap.cgi web interface for Nmap
  -- Should have "demo" mode that only allows users to scan their own addy

o Create or collect some great ./configure ascii art.

o Add randomizer to configure script so that a random ASCII art from
  docs/leet-nmap-ascii-art*.txt is printed.  I think I'll start naming
  them leet-nmap-ascii-art-submittername.txt.

o Add general regression unit testing system to Nmap

o Talk to Libpcap folks about incorporating (at least some of) my
  changes from libpcap/NMAP_MODIFICATIONS.

o Add --evil to set the RFC3514 evil bit.
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3514.txt
  o We're not going to add this right now.

o The Nmap web page is beginning to show its age.  Ah, who am I
  kidding, it was showing its age 5 years ago :).  It could do with an
  upgrade to XHTML+CSS.  It could also do with a whole redesign, but I
  think that can be done as a second step after converting to
  XHTML+CSS with roughly the same look.  Though adding a few more
  modern touches (like hover interaction on the menu bar) wouldn't
  hurt.  This is a moderatly big project, which will involve: o
  Designing the new XHTML+CSS to look similar to the current HTML
  pages, but be extensible enough that it can be redesigned in the
  (near) future by mostly just changing the CSS and graphics.  
    o Converting the existing Nmap pages to the new XHTML format.
      This will likely include using open source programs and likely
      modifying them or creating your own scripts to help with the
      process.  To apply for this task, you need to have some web
      development experience and an example XHTML+CSS web page you
      have created online.

o Provide an option to send a comment in scan packet data for target
  network.  Examples: --comment "Scan conducted by Marc Reis from
  SecOps, extension 2147" or --comment "pH33r my l3eT
  s|&lt;iLLz!  I'll 0wN UR b0x!"
  o Note, this shouldn't be implemented yet.

o I should add code to Nmap to bail if sizeof(char) isn't 1.
  Otherwise there could be security risks if it is not one on any
  platforms.

o Consider implementing RPC scan with ultra_scan or something else.
  Right now it is the only program using pos_scan.  On the other hand,
  I'm not sure TCP rpc scanning is appropriate for ultra_scan.

o Look at all the pcap functions, there are some like
  pcap_findalldevs() which could be quite useful.  There are mails to
  the Nmap list relating to suggested improvements --
  http://seclists.org/lists/nmap-dev/2004/Apr-Jun/0024.html .
  Actually I do indirectly use that for Windows. I wonder if they work
  for UNIX?

o Update Nmap entry on Linux Online -
  http://www.linux.org/apps/AppId_1979.html

o perhaps each 'match' line in nmap-service-probes should have a
  maximum lines, bytes, and/or time by which a response should be
  available.  Once that much time (or many bytes or lines) have passed,
  that match can be considered 'failed' and ignored in subsequent runs.
  Once all matches are considered failed, that probe is done.  This
  could be a useful optimization and is arguably better than the less
  granular 'totalwaitms'.  Or I could just have a simple function that
  looks at whether a given regex could possibly match something
  starting with the received data (not too hard since almost all of
  the current regexes are anchored).  But before doing this, I should
  look long and hard at how many of the probes have every match
  capable of doing this.  In particular, many of the softmatch lines
  don't offer many chars anchored at the front.

o Add detection of duplicate machines via IP.ID uber-technique.
   Maybe I should use uptime timestamps too.  Oh, and MAC addresses too.

o Separate nbase into its own Windows library in the same way as Andy did
   with iphlpapi .

o Look into iplog ( http://ojnk.sourceforge.net/ ) -z option which is 
  supposed to fool OS detection.

o security audit of Nmap code

o Nmap / Nmap-hackers FAQ

o random tip database

DONE:

o Change Nmap signature files to use the .sig extension rather than
  .gpg.txt, as that seems to be what gpg recommends.  In fact, gpg
  will automatically verify the right file if it exists after dropping
  the .sig (or .asc) extension.  I may need to configure .htaccess to
  serve .sig files properly.  Update nmap-install.xml
  accordingly. Suggested by tic at eternalrealm.net by email on
  7/13/08. [Fyodor]
  * Rename existing files, add symlink from the old .gpg.txt to .asc
    versions
  * Add appropriate .htaccess content type if needed for downloads
   - not needed since I decided on .asc extension rather than .sig
  * Update the generation scripts
  * Update the book documentation -
    http://nmap.org/book/install.html#inst-integrity

o Ask Coverity if they'll scan latest version of Nmap. [Fyodor asked
  David Maxwell on 5/14/09 ]

o Make 4.85BETA9 release [Fyodor]

o [Zenmap] Make a way to start a scan from the profile editor without
  creating a profile, then remove the command wizard.  This is partial
  implementation of
  http://www.bamsoftware.com/wiki/Nmap/ZenmapCommandLine. [David]

o [Ncat] Make proxy server mode work on Windows (this is the last
  remaining fork() dependency in Ncat).

o Do an OS detection integration run -- last was based on
  1/8/09. [David]

o [Ncat] Maybe we should create an SSL cert with no passphrase during
  Ncat compilation or install process so that if someone specifies
  Ncat -l and --ssl with no --ssl-cert and --ssl-key, we already have
  one for them, and it is a slightly better one (since the private key
  isn't known) than if we distributed a key.  Obviously it is still
  subject to MITM attacks since there is no domain validation going
  on.  But people who need that will have to buy a key from a
  certificate authority in any case.  We could create the key by using
  the "openssl" command line tool as shown in
  http://nmap.org/ncat/guide/ncat-advanced.html#ncat-ssl, or maybe
  better to have a way for ncat to do it using openssl calls. [David]

o [Zenmap] Should probably give some sort of widget indication that a
  scan is running.  Now that we can start multiple scans at once, the
  "scan" button goes back to being unpressed while the scan is
  running.  As some scans take minutes or more to show output, it is
  not always clear whether they are still properly running.  We should
  probably have some sort of widget, such as the throbber used in web
  browsers, to show that Nmap is still running.  It could be fore a
  specific scan (kind of like how you have a separate throbber for
  each tab on a web browser), or a global one which means at least one
  scan is running.  Or maybe a different sort of indication is in
  order (like a timer). [David]

o Further investigate Nmap Proxy patch by Zoltan Panczel and Ferenc
  Spala.  See http://nmap-dev.fw.hu/ and
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0255.html . [Discussed it and
  then added new proxy feature item]

o Wherever practical, fix compiler warnings when compiling Nmap with
  VC++ 2008 Express SP1 (there aren't many). [David]

o [NSE] Consider adding boolean expressions to --script arguments.  For
  example, see Patrick's implementation at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q3/0300.html .

o Generate a list of trusted SSL certificates to ship with Ncat (by
  extracting f rom Mozilla or similar), and install them with
  Ncat. Decide how these certificat es should be preferred to any
  system-provided certs, if any. [David]

o [NSE] Add desired SoC09 infrastructure ideas to this TODO to the
  extent they don't already exist.

o [Ncat] Consider supporting server certificate verification when used
  in client SSL mode.
  o For now we document in user's guide that it is not secure.
  o Maybe we can do an ssh-style approach where we just print the
    fingerprint and expect the ncat client user to ensure it is the
    right one?
  o If we're going to verify cert's etc., we need to also make sure we
    are actually using secure ciphers.  We may need to update nsock to
    support cipher selection, because we want fast ones for version
    detection, but usually want secure ones for NSE and/or ncat.
  o Do we want to check all this by default, or offer an option for
    it?  Doing it by default is more secure, though it can be annoying
    when a certificate has expired, is self-signed, you connect to
    domain.com when the certificate is for www.domain.com, etc.  If it
    is done by deault, we might just print an error message.  Whreas
    if we have a special option, it may be OK to exit and refuse the
    connection.
  o What certs should we allow?  Same as the browsers do?  Maybe get
    rid of Comodo?  Maybe we should fail to recognize any certs with MD5
    in the trust chain?
  o What about people who are running their own SSL service and just
    want to specify the cert file they use, because they generated it
    themself and not from a trusted CA.
  o Need to check expiration, domain, etc. if we're checking certs at
    all.
  o We can probably get away with not doing revocation checking, as
    long as we document that we don't.

o consider changing status field from "up" and "down" to "online" and
  "offline".  Actually, maybe we don't want this after all.
  online/offline look pretty similar, and they're longer too.  I'm
  taking this out of the TODO.

o [Ncat] When acting as an HTTP proxy, we should support GET mode as
  well as CONNECT so that it works as a non-SSL proxy in browsers such
  as firefox. [David]

o Finalize GSoC applicant research, communication, and selection
  [David, Fyodor]

o Go through all the SoC applicants and decide who we want to accept
  and start communicating with them. [David,Fyodor]
 o Decide which applicants we want, and who would be best for
    mentoring them.

o Document that U1.RID gives "G" as long as all the data bytes in the
  echoed response data are "C" as expected.  This G code is still
  given even when the response is truncated, including if there are 0
  bytes echoed. [David]

o [Ndiff] Rethink the output format. David says: In particular, I
  would like to always have the old state on the left and the new
  state on the right: "was filtered, is open," not "is open, was
  filtered." I also like the context diff output of MadHat's
  nmap-diff. [David]


o Canonicalize the "host up" messages for port scan and ping scan so
  that instead of things like "Host scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52)
  appears to be up ... good." we standardize in both cases on
  something like: "Host scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52) is up (.75s
  latency)".  Note the addition of the latency value, which is our
  srtt value for the host.  This will only show in ping scan and
  verbose port scan because the line doesn't appear without verbose
  mode. [David]

o Ping scans always seem to say "0 [hosts] undergoing Ping Scan" when
  you request stats, rather than the proper number.  For an example,
  try a command such as "nmap -iR 10000 -sP -n" and then press enter
  during the scan.  Here are some examples of the bad output: Stats:
  25:34:33 elapsed; 991232 hosts completed (72530 up), 0 undergoing
  Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 53.69% done; ETC: 22:49 (0:00:09
  remaining) Stats: 0:01:10 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (0 up), 0
  undergoing Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 24.03% done; ETC: 22:42
  (0:03:41 remaining) Stats: 0:03:28 elapsed; 4096 hosts completed
  (284 up), 0 undergoing Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 3.06% done;
  ETC: 22:44 (0:03:07 remaining) [David]


o Remove obsolete tests from nmap-os-db itself. [David]

o Prepare for Summer of Code
 * Brainstorm for ideas
 * Create new ideas page
 * Apply to participate in program again
 * Advertise for applicants
 * Evaluate applicants

o NSEDoc script/module documentation pages should probably provide a
  link to the script/module source code (except for C modules).  The
  link format should probably be of the form
  http://nmap.org/data/scripts/[script].nse and
  /data/nselib/[module].lua.  NSEdoc can assume they already exist
  there, as we'll probably put them there using the same system we use
  to copy other stuff to the data dir.

o [Ncat] Let people set up authenticated proxies using
  --listen and --proxy-auth together (right now we don't support
  that). [David]

o When you specify multiple comma-separated arguments to --script,
  those arguments seem to get lost when the Nmap command is printed in
  Nmap's output files.  For example, I run the command:
  nmap -oN - --script=discovery,intrusive scanme.nmap.org
  The output includes:
  # Nmap 4.85BETA4 scan initiated Thu Mar 26 15:40:05 2009 as: ./nmap
    -oN - --script=discovery scanme.nmap.org
  Note the missing ",intrusive" in the script argument. [David]

o Merge patrick/nse-lua-merge for easier-to-maintain and simpler
  codebase once David and Patrick are happy with it. [David]

o SVN check out /nmap as an external in a directory named svn or src
  or nmapsvn or something under nmap.org web tree.  Then redirect the
  individual nmap.org/data/ files, where needed, to the nmapsvn
  instead.  and update nmap-dev Makefile not to copy them to the
  /data/ dir anymore. Then update the nsedoc system to generate proper
  links to the new script/nselib locations. [Fyodor]

o Improvements to presentation of version detection
  information. [Brandon]
  o Allow longer strings.  Right now it can be 128 chars for the
    fullversion info, I think.  But that isn't enough for this useful
    information-packed string: "Apache httpd 2.0.52 ((Red Hat)
    mod_perl/1.99_16 Perl/v5.8.5 DAV/2 mod_jk/1.2.19 PHP/4.3.9
    mod_python/3.1.3 Python/2.3.4 mod_ssl/2.0.52 OpenSSL/0.9.7a)".
    After discussion w/Brandon, we're going to allow 160 chars total.
  o Instead of omitting all information when version info string too
    long, we're going to truncate and allow 157 characters, plus
    ellipses (...)
  o Brandon says: "my final gripe is that the full version string is
    constructed as <product><space><version><space>(<extrainfo>).
    but, even if product or version are blank, the spaces are still
    there"

o I need an output-autoflush option of some sort.  This could be
  useful to ensure I get all the --packet_trace and debug data before
  Nmap crashes.  Actually, I'm not sure that is so critical.
  o Killing it for now, not sure that it even is needed.

o Fix the directory function(s) in nse_fs.cc to be usable by scripts and
  improve flexibility. [this entry added by Patrick]

o [Ncat] The sys_wrap.c/.h code contains a whole bunch of capitalized
  versions of system calls (Fork(), Socket(), Sscanf(), etc.) which
  are mostly the same as the standard version except that they cause
  ncat to quit if they are triggered.  They also may be used partially
  for portability.  The main issues are:
   1) Because the function quits in the case of errors, it doesn't
      always have the context to print a useful error message (and
      even when it does, it often doesn't -- for example Fopen could
      print the filename, but doesn't.)  Also, sometimes these
      functions are called when quitting really isn't the desired
      outcome of an error.
   2) Some could be replaced by code in nbase, for example, Malloc
      basically does the same thing as our safe_malloc already used
      throughout Nmap.
  So we should probably consider simplifying/removing this code to the
  extent possible.  But we need to remember to add error detection to
  the callers where necessary rather than blindly switching from
  (e.g.) Connect() to connect(). [Kris or David]

o With --version-trace (may be a problem with other uses of nsock
  tracing too), I often get dozens of "wait_for_events" reports in a
  row in a very short period, flooding the logs.  For example, with
  the command "nmap -sV --version-trace www.google.com", I get:
  NSOCK (22.3570s) Callback: WRITE SUCCESS for EID 283 [74.125.19.147:443]
  NSOCK (22.3570s) msevent_delete (IOD #4) (EID #283)
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  NSOCK (22.3570s) wait_for_events
  [Goes on for pages]

o NSE memory issues (and gh_list assert failure) [David]
  o See this thread: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0532.html
  o We're taking this out for now since the new nse-lua-merge
  tenatively looks like it fixes this.

o [Ncat] Why does Ncat require enclosure in a while loop to answer
  repeated UDP queries, but not TCP?  For example, see the "Emulating
  Diagnostic Services" section of the Ncat user's guide.
  o Note: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0133.html

o Determine what we should do about the IE.DLI OS detection test [David]
  o All of the 1656 results for this test in nmap-os-db are DLI=S.
    o Is the test not working right (producing the proper results
      against targets), or is it just a generally useless test for
      which virtually all targets respond the same way?
  o Are there other "useless" tests in nmap-os-db?  It is worth
    checking, IMHO.
  o We're going to get rid of IE.DLI, IE.SI, U1.RUL, and maybe TOS and
    TOSI tests.

o When you do ncat -h, Ncat should probably show the Nmap version
  number rather than (currently) 0.2.  Also ncat in -v mode should
  show that same header. [David]

o Ncat verbose mode (-v) should probably only give important messages,
  such as perhaps a message once you connect successfully to a port,
  or a message if the connection attempt times out.  An Ncat version
  banner (with URL) like Nmap has might be warranted (in verbose
  mode).  Currently, Ncat floods you with (mostly) useless debugging
  information like this with a single -v (this output, on the other
  hand, might be useful for a debugging option): [David]
  # ncat -C -v scanme.nmap.org 80
  NSOCK (0.0000s) TCP connection requested to 64.13.134.52:80 (IOD #1) EID 8
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Callback: CONNECT SUCCESS for EID 8 [64.13.134.52:80]
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Read request from IOD #1 [64.13.134.52:80] (timeout: -1ms) EID 18
  NSOCK (0.0200s) Read request for 0 bytes from IOD #2 (peer unspecified) EID 26
  GET / HTTP/1.0
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Callback READ SUCCESS for EID 26 (peer unspecified) (15 bytes)
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Write request for 16 bytes to IOD #1 EID 35 [64.13.134.52:80]
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Callback: WRITE SUCCESS for EID 35 [64.13.134.52:80]
  NSOCK (4.4280s) Read request for 0 bytes from IOD #2 (peer unspecified) EID 42
  For comparison, here is what Eric Jackson's nc (The nc available in
  Fedora 10's package repository) shows in verbose mode for the same
  connection:
  # nc -v scanme.nmap.org 80
  Connection to scanme.nmap.org 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
  GET / HTTP/1.0 [David]

o Final polishing of our GSoC pages. [Fyodor]

o Advertise widely for Nmap GSoC applicants [Fyodor]

o [Ncat] We should (maybe) consider a way for people to choose
  usernames in --chat.
  o Removing this for now.  We can add it back if we decide we really
    want this.

o Deal with new Python 2.6 Zenmap build warnings:
  C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\py2exe\build_exe.py:16: DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
  import sets
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2314799&group_id=15583&atid=115583
  [Bug in py2exe, will probably be fixed with a new version of py2exe
  once it is released and we upgrade.  This isn't causing us any major
  problem anyway.]

o When I scan large groups of hosts with OS detection enabled, I get
  groups of warnings like:
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0), OS detection may be less accurate
  Note how it doesn't even tell the relevant IP address, and it isn't
  included in an individual host section.  We should probably either
  include it in the section for an individual host, like we do with
  "OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least
  1 open and 1 closed port", or (not quite as
  good) include the relevant IP address in the error message.  And we
  may or may not want to require verbose mode.

o Ncat chat should bomine the "already connected" user list into one
  line, like:
  <announce> already connected: 69.232.238.42 is connected as <user5>, 206.81.65.43 as <user4>, 69.232.238.42 as <user6>

o [Ndiff] Maybe Ndiff should display changes to version detection and
  OS detection information? [David]
 o Version detection done, now just needs OS detection.

o When I start ncat chat with this tcsh command:
  ncat -l --chat scanme.nmap.org < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
  The first client to connect to the chat becomes user0 and doesn't
  work quite right.  Messages user0 type get transmitted to other
  clients, but user0 does not see their messages.  Nore does user0 get
  the normal connection announcement upon connecting.  If I quit
  user0, the next client to connect becomes user0 again and has the
  same problem.  If I start ncat on the server with "ncat -l --chat
  scanme.nmap.org" (no redirection), other clients can connect with no problems.

o Ncat --chat should probably announce to everyone (including the new
  person) when someone connects.  This tells the new person their
  username, and lets everyone else know about the new connection. [David]
  o We should also tell the new person (and possibly everyone on the
   channel) the list of existing participants.

o SoC ideas page [Fyodor]

o Nmap 4.85BETA4 release [Fyodor]

o [Ncat] Wouldn't it be nice if we could support --exec (and maybe
  some sort of partial-emulated --sh-exec) on Windows? [David]
  o Almost working!  We found some problems with "ncat.exe -v -l
  --sh-exec "ncat -v scanme.nmap.org"

o [Ncat] Can we use it as an IPv4 <-> IPv6 gateway?  If so (or if we
  can add it), it should be added to the ncat guide feature list.
  o Yes, David tried it with --sh-exec and it worked.

o [Ncat] We should probably make it work without OpenSSL.  When I try
  ./configure --without-openssl on latest svn Nmap, Ncat build fails
  with:
       gcc -MM -I../libpcap -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -I. -I.. -I../nsock/include/ -I../nbase ncat_main.c ncat_connect.c ncat_core.c ncat_listen.c ncat_proxy.c ncat_broker.c ncat_hostmatch.c ncat_ssl.c util.c sys_wrap.c > makefile.dep

o [Ncat] Defensive coding review of Ncat --chat (talk)

o [Ncat] As SSL server it should not crash when someone connects in
  w/o SSL and does ^C.  When David tried it during our chat, the ncat
  servr "ncat --broker --ssl-key test-key.pem --ssl-cert test-cert.pem
  --ssl --chat -l"  crashed with: SSL_accept():
  error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0).  Also, when a Windows SSL
  clients joined and then left, the server died with "Broken pipe

o [Ncat] --chat should probably only allow reasonable chars, to avoid
  cntrl-chars, etc.

o Nmap should treat ports named "unknown" in nmap-services the same
  way (from a naming perspective) as it treats ports which are not
  listed at all.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0589.html.

o Ncat user guide "Emulating Diagnostic Services" page has a very long
  UDP chargen server line which causes wrapping problems in web browsers
  (e.g. it widens the page substantially).  It should probably be
  split into multiple lines. [David]

o Ncat user guide proxying section says "The only exception is when
  listing a proxy host by IPv6 address; then the port is required."
  Why would we require a port number for IPv6 rather than just use the
  same defaults as we do for IPv4?
  [David explained that this is because to do otherwise would be
  ambiguous because IPv6 uses : for separaters, so we wouldn't know
  how to handle things like FF::10:80]

o [Ncat] Perhaps we should make --ssl work in --chat.  If nothing
  else, it might be useful if you want to reduce the number of people
  connecting with telnet, etc. rather than ncat.

o [Ncat] --talk should probably be changed (in the code and
  documentation) to --chat, as Ncat chat has a
  much nicer ring to it, IMHO.  --talk should remain as an alias to
  --chat, but we don't need to document it. [David]

o Ncat Windows issue where you make a connection and then take several
  seconds to type in a line to the server, Ncat wrongly times out when
  trying to write your line to the remote server. [David]

o Ncat write timeout problems cause client to quit due to write
  timeout sometimes. [David]
  Examples:
   o yes | ncat localhost
   o when we paste a few lines into the terminal window in an Ncat chat

o Defensive coding review of ncat_proxy.* [David]

o Process the latest version detection submissions.  We now have more
  than 1,700 of them queued up. [Doug]

o Write Ncat users' guide, demonstrating all the neat stuff you can do
  with it.  This should probably be in DocBook XML so it can be an NNS
  chapter.  You might want to query nmap-dev for list of neat things
  people do with ncat (or look around for what people do with nc).
  Testing it out for examples might expose areas for improvement as
  well. [David]

o Look at Dario Ciccarone's email from 5/1/07 about IPID sequence
  issues, and consider adding IPID sequence test for closed-port-tcp as
  they apparently can be different. [David]
  o Also fix bug which causes SEQ to not be printed if the TCP open
    port tests fail to produce results, even though the II and
    (upcoming) CI tests may have useful results. [David]

o NSE should offer some way to sleep/yield for a given amount of
  time.  This would allow other scripts to run while a script has
  nothing to do.  Possible uses:
  o Many services have rate limits (or you might just want to use them
    for politeness).  For example, a web site spidering application
    might want to limit HTTP requests to some number per second to avoid
    pissing off the target webmaster more than is necessary (or prevent
    getting auto-blocked).  Similarly, whois servers often will block
    IPs which query them too often in a short period.  Or maybe you
    don't want to exceed the threshold limits of an IDS.
  o Example current scripts which might benefit: sql-injection, whois
    (possibly), pop3-brute, etc.
  o If we don't currently have a way for a cpu-bound NSE script to
    yield, then perhaps this could help us implement such a mechanism.
    But maybe coroutine.yield already does the trick.
  o The mechanism needs to be documented, and ideally should be
    implemented in at least one of the scripts shipped with Nmap.

o Consider adding a way for requesting timing status updates at a
  given interval (such as every 5 seconds) to XML and/or normal
  output.  This would be useful for people who run Nmap from scripts
  or other higher level applications. [David]

o Ncat --allow/--deny bug: "--allow and --deny only support host
  specification by IP address, and give no warning when you use
  another form such as a host name." Should probably use same syntax
  as --exclude. We also want to at least do verification at the
  beginning to make sure all the entries are legitimately formed.  We
  probably want to do things like DNS resolution at the beginning
  too. Otherwise we might have a DNS failure when we actually get a
  connection and perhaps have to reject the connection wrongly, or
  risk a false negative.  [David]

o Fix this overflow:
  Stats: 93:57:40 elapsed; 254868 hosts completed (2048 up), 2048 undergoing UDP Scan
  UDP Scan Timing: About 11.34% done; ETC: 03:21 (-688:-41:-48 remaining)
  [Done by David and Henri Doreau]

o Ncat -- perhaps connection brokering should support UDP as well as
  (its existing support for) TCP?  Actually this does raise issues
  such as deciding what list of UDP systems to forward a packet too.
  Its obviously not like TCP where you have a list of open
  connections.  Ncat could build such a list, but, for example, would
  never know when to remove the host.  For now, David is just going to
  adjust the error message to encourage people to email nmap-dev
  describing their usage scenario if they want this feature.

o Ncat documentation should note that no SSL certificate verification
  is done (maybe we should offer an option to do so, if OpenSSL makes
  that easy).
  o Done in the new Ncat user's guide

o Fix dns-zone-transfer infinite recursion bug described at
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0317.html.  It sounds like the
  best approach is to use our dns.lua library rather than having
  dns-zone-transfer do its own DNS packet parsing.

o Fix XML escaping issue so that improper chars from NSE scripts or
  elsewhere can't cause corrupt XML files.  See
  http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0316.html for an example. [David]

o Look into whether we should increase the frequency of port scan
  pings.  See http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2008/q1/0096.html . Note
  that Fyodor already increased them a bit in 2008.  Might not need
  more.  [David did extensive testing of this one already]

o Find way to document NSE library script arguments and perhaps have
  them bubble up to scripts themselves.  For example, I had to read
  the SNMP library source code to determine the script argument to
  specify the SNMP community name for snmp-sysdescr
  (http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/snmp-sysdescr.html).  Maybe we could
  just standardize on something like we do with SMB library and the
  scripts which call it (http://nmap.org/nsedoc/modules/smb.html,
  http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-check-vulns.html). [David]

o If it wouldn't bloat things too much, it would be nice to include
  ndiff in the Nmap win32 zip distribution files.

o Reported NSE crash:
  "Assertion failed - file ..\nse_main.cc line 314
   lua_gettop(L_script_scan) == 0"
  o He says: "After looking at this closer, it appears the assertion
    occurs if I include the IP where the scan is run from. For us, I'm
    running this on IP 57, which is a VMware Windows Server image.  If
    I eliminate that IP from the range it successfully completed the
    scan for all other devices."
  o Seems to be fixed.  He can no longer reproduce the problem with
    4.85BETA3.

o Deal with GTK DLL problem with Nmap 4.85BETA1: [Fyodor]
  o David's installer seems to work--he's using a different GTK
    distribution.  I'll try that.  Works!  Done!
  o Details on problem: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0207.html
  o Quick workaround done for 4.85BETA2, but better solution needed.

o "SCRIPT ENGINE (250.600s): ./scripts/rpcinfo.nse against
  a.b.c.d:<port> ended with error: ./nselib/datafiles.lua:114: attempt
  to index global 'arg' (a nil value)"
  -- http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0227.html [Patrick]

o Consider making the TODO list public
  o Done: http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0175.html
  o Probably remove all of the "done" items since that is easier than
    reviewing them.
  o Might as well add to insecure.org/nmap/data/
  o Maybe a bug tracker is a better approach.
