.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.\" Nmap: description of
.PP
Nmap (\(lqNetwork Mapper\(rq) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing\&. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts\&. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics\&. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime\&.
.PP
The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used\&. Key among that information is the
\(lqinteresting ports table\(rq\&.
.\" ports: \(lqinteresting\(rq
That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state\&. The state is either
open,
filtered,
closed, or
unfiltered\&.
Open
.\" open port state
means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port\&.
Filtered
.\" filtered port state
means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
open
or
closed\&.
Closed
.\" closed port state
ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time\&. Ports are classified as
unfiltered
.\" unfiltered port state
when they are responsive to Nmap\*(Aqs probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed\&. Nmap reports the state combinations
open|filtered
.\" open|filtered port state
and
closed|filtered
.\" closed|filtered port state
when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port\&. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested\&. When an IP protocol scan is requested (\fB\-sO\fR), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports\&.
.PP
In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses\&.

Example\ \&1\&. The only Nmap arguments used in this example are

.SH "TARGET SPECIFICATION"
.\" target specification
.PP
Everything on the Nmap command\-line that isn\*(Aqt an option (or option argument) is treated as a target host specification\&. The simplest case is to specify a target IP address or hostname for scanning\&.
.PP
Sometimes you wish to scan a whole network of adjacent hosts\&. For this, Nmap supports CIDR\-style
.\" CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
addressing\&. You can append
/\fInumbits\fR
to an IPv4 address or hostname and Nmap will scan every IP address for which the first
\fInumbits\fR
are the same as for the reference IP or hostname given\&. For example,
192\&.168\&.10\&.0/24
would scan the 256 hosts between 192\&.168\&.10\&.0 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000) and 192\&.168\&.10\&.255 (binary:
11000000 10101000 00001010 11111111), inclusive\&.
192\&.168\&.10\&.40/24
would scan exactly the same targets\&. Given that the host scanme\&.nmap\&.org
.\" scanme.nmap.org
is at the IP address 64\&.13\&.134\&.52, the specification
scanme\&.nmap\&.org/16
would scan the 65,536 IP addresses between 64\&.13\&.0\&.0 and 64\&.13\&.255\&.255\&. The smallest allowed value is
/0, which targets the whole Internet\&. The largest value is
/32, which scans just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed\&.
.\" address ranges
.PP
CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough\&. For example, you might want to scan 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with \&.0 or \&.255 because they may be used as subnet network and broadcast addresses\&. Nmap supports this through octet range addressing\&. Rather than specify a normal IP address, you can specify a comma\-separated list of numbers or ranges for each octet\&. For example,
192\&.168\&.0\-255\&.1\-254
will skip all addresses in the range that end in \&.0 or \&.255, and
192\&.168\&.3\-5,7\&.1
will scan the four addresses 192\&.168\&.3\&.1, 192\&.168\&.4\&.1, 192\&.168\&.5\&.1, and 192\&.168\&.7\&.1\&. Either side of a range may be omitted; the default values are 0 on the left and 255 on the right\&. Using
\-
by itself is the same as
0\-255, but remember to use
0\-
in the first octet so the target specification doesn\*(Aqt look like a command\-line option\&. Ranges need not be limited to the final octets: the specifier
0\-255\&.0\-255\&.13\&.37
will perform an Internet\-wide scan for all IP addresses ending in 13\&.37\&. This sort of broad sampling can be useful for Internet surveys and research\&.
.\" IPv6
.PP
IPv6 addresses can be specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname or with CIDR notation for subnets\&. Octet ranges aren\*(Aqt yet supported for IPv6\&.
.\" link-local IPv6 address
.\" IPv6 address: link-local
.\" zone ID (IPv6 address)
.PP
IPv6 addresses with non\-global scope need to have a zone ID suffix\&. On Unix systems, this is a percent sign followed by an interface name; a complete address might be
fe80::a8bb:ccff:fedd:eeff%eth0\&. On Windows, use an interface index number in place of an interface name:
fe80::a8bb:ccff:fedd:eeff%1\&. You can see a list of interface indexes by running the command
\fBnetsh\&.exe interface ipv6 show interface\fR\&.
.PP
Nmap accepts multiple host specifications on the command line, and they don\*(Aqt need to be the same type\&. The command
\fBnmap scanme\&.nmap\&.org 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/8 10\&.0\&.0,1,3\-7\&.\-\fR
does what you would expect\&.
.PP
While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:
.PP
\fB\-iL \fR\fB\fIinputfilename\fR\fR (Input from list) 
.\" -iL .\" target specification: from list
.RS 4
Reads target specifications from
\fIinputfilename\fR\&. Passing a huge list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it is a common desire\&. For example, your DHCP server might export a list of 10,000 current leases that you wish to scan\&. Or maybe you want to scan all IP addresses
\fIexcept\fR
for those to locate hosts using unauthorized static IP addresses\&. Simply generate the list of hosts to scan and pass that filename to Nmap as an argument to the
\fB\-iL\fR
option\&. Entries can be in any of the formats accepted by Nmap on the command line (IP address, hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or octet ranges)\&. Each entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines\&. You can specify a hyphen (\-) as the filename if you want Nmap to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual file\&.
.sp
The input file may contain comments that start with
#
and extend to the end of the line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-iR \fR\fB\fInum hosts\fR\fR (Choose random targets) 
.\" -iR .\" random targets .\" target specification: at random
.RS 4
For Internet\-wide surveys and other research, you may want to choose targets at random\&. The
\fInum hosts\fR
argument tells Nmap how many IPs to generate\&. Undesirable IPs such as those in certain private, multicast, or unallocated address ranges are automatically skipped\&. The argument
0
can be specified for a never\-ending scan\&. Keep in mind that some network administrators bristle at unauthorized scans of their networks and may complain\&. Use this option at your own risk! If you find yourself really bored one rainy afternoon, try the command

\fB\-\-exclude \fR\fB\fIhost1\fR\fR\fB[,\fIhost2\fR[,\&.\&.\&.]]\fR (Exclude hosts/networks) 
.\" --exclude .\" excluding targets
.RS 4
Specifies a comma\-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network range you specify\&. The list you pass in uses normal Nmap syntax, so it can include hostnames, CIDR netblocks, octet ranges, etc\&. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan includes untouchable mission\-critical servers, systems that are known to react adversely to port scans, or subnets administered by other people\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-excludefile \fR\fB\fIexclude_file\fR\fR (Exclude list from file)

.RS 4
This offers the same functionality as the
\fB\-\-exclude\fR
option, except that the excluded targets are provided in a newline\-, space\-, or tab\-delimited
\fIexclude_file\fR
rather than on the command line\&.
.sp
The exclude file may contain comments that start with
#

.RE
.SH "HOST DISCOVERY"
.\" host discovery
.PP
One of the very first steps in any network reconnaissance mission is to reduce a (sometimes huge) set of IP ranges into a list of active or interesting hosts\&. Scanning every port of every single IP address is slow and usually unnecessary\&. Of course what makes a host interesting depends greatly on the scan purposes\&. Network administrators may only be interested in hosts running a certain service, while security auditors may care about every single device with an IP address\&. An administrator may be comfortable using just an ICMP ping to locate hosts on his internal network, while an external penetration tester may use a diverse set of dozens of probes in an attempt to evade firewall restrictions\&.
.PP
Because host discovery needs are so diverse, Nmap offers a wide variety of options for customizing the techniques used\&. Host discovery is sometimes called ping scan, but it goes well beyond the simple ICMP echo request packets associated with the ubiquitous
ping
tool\&. Users can skip the ping step entirely with a list scan (\fB\-sL\fR) or by disabling ping (\fB\-Pn\fR), or engage the network with arbitrary combinations of multi\-port TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, SCTP INIT and ICMP probes\&. The goal of these probes is to solicit responses which demonstrate that an IP address is actually active (is being used by a host or network device)\&. On many networks, only a small percentage of IP addresses are active at any given time\&. This is particularly common with private address space such as 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8\&. That network has 16 million IPs, but I have seen it used by companies with less than a thousand machines\&. Host discovery can find those machines in a sparsely allocated sea of IP addresses\&.
.PP
If no host discovery options are given, Nmap sends an ICMP echo request, a TCP SYN packet to port 443, a TCP ACK packet to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request\&. (For IPv6, the ICMP timestamp request is omitted because it is not part of ICMPv6\&.) These defaults are equivalent to the
\fB\-PE \-PS443 \-PA80 \-PP\fR
options\&. The exceptions to this are the ARP (for IPv4) and Neighbor Discovery
.\" Neighbor Discovery: for host discovery
(for IPv6) scans which are used for any targets on a local ethernet network\&. For unprivileged Unix shell users, the default probes are a SYN packet to ports 80 and 443 using the
\fBconnect\fR
system call\&.
.\" unprivileged users: limitations of
This host discovery is often sufficient when scanning local networks, but a more comprehensive set of discovery probes is recommended for security auditing\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-P*\fR
options (which select ping types) can be combined\&. You can increase your odds of penetrating strict firewalls by sending many probe types using different TCP ports/flags and ICMP codes\&. Also note that ARP/Neighbor Discovery (\fB\-PR\fR)
.\" -PR
is done by default against targets on a local ethernet network even if you specify other
\fB\-P*\fR
options, because it is almost always faster and more effective\&.
.PP
By default, Nmap does host discovery and then performs a port scan against each host it determines is online\&. This is true even if you specify non\-default host discovery types such as UDP probes (\fB\-PU\fR)\&. Read about the
\fB\-sn\fR
option to learn how to perform only host discovery, or use
\fB\-Pn\fR
to skip host discovery and port scan all target hosts\&. The following options control host discovery:
.PP
\fB\-sL\fR (List Scan) 
.\" -sL .\" list scan
.RS 4
The list scan is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending any packets to the target hosts\&. By default, Nmap still does reverse\-DNS resolution on the hosts to learn their names\&. It is often surprising how much useful information simple hostnames give out\&. For example,
fw\&.chi
is the name of one company\*(Aqs Chicago firewall\&.
.\" DNS: records as source of information
Nmap also reports the total number of IP addresses at the end\&. The list scan is a good sanity check to ensure that you have proper IP addresses for your targets\&. If the hosts sport domain names you do not recognize, it is worth investigating further to prevent scanning the wrong company\*(Aqs network\&.
.sp
Since the idea is to simply print a list of target hosts, options for higher level functionality such as port scanning, OS detection, or ping scanning cannot be combined with this\&. If you wish to disable ping scanning while still performing such higher level functionality, read up on the
\fB\-Pn\fR
(skip ping) option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-sn\fR (No port scan) 
.\" -sn .\" ping scan .\" port scan: disabling with -sn
.RS 4
This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes\&. This is often known as a
\(lqping scan\(rq, but you can also request that traceroute and NSE host scripts be run\&. This is by default one step more intrusive than the list scan, and can often be used for the same purposes\&. It allows light reconnaissance of a target network without attracting much attention\&. Knowing how many hosts are up is more valuable to attackers than the list provided by list scan of every single IP and host name\&.
.sp
Systems administrators often find this option valuable as well\&. It can easily be used to count available machines on a network or monitor server availability\&. This is often called a ping sweep, and is more reliable than pinging the broadcast address because many hosts do not reply to broadcast queries\&.
.sp
The default host discovery done with
\fB\-sn\fR
consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default\&. When executed by an unprivileged user, only SYN packets are sent (using a
\fBconnect\fR
call) to ports 80 and 443 on the target\&. When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local ethernet network, ARP requests are used unless
\fB\-\-send\-ip\fR
was specified\&. The
\fB\-sn\fR
option can be combined with any of the discovery probe types (the
\fB\-P*\fR
options, excluding
\fB\-Pn\fR) for greater flexibility\&. If any of those probe type and port number options are used, the default probes are overridden\&. When strict firewalls are in place between the source host running Nmap and the target network, using those advanced techniques is recommended\&. Otherwise hosts could be missed when the firewall drops probes or their responses\&.

The TCP ACK ping is quite similar to the just\-discussed SYN ping\&. The difference, as you could likely guess, is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the SYN flag\&. Such an ACK packet purports to be acknowledging data over an established TCP connection, but no such connection exists\&. So remote hosts should always respond with a RST packet, disclosing their existence in the process\&.

\fBconnect\fR
is actually sending a SYN packet rather than an ACK\&.
.sp
The reason for offering both SYN and ACK ping probes is to maximize the chances of bypassing firewalls\&. Many administrators configure routers and other simple firewalls to block incoming SYN packets except for those destined for public services like the company web site or mail server\&. This prevents other incoming connections to the organization, while allowing users to make unobstructed outgoing connections to the Internet\&. This non\-stateful approach takes up few resources on the firewall/router and is widely supported by hardware and software filters\&. The Linux Netfilter/iptables
.\" iptables
firewall software offers the
\fB\-\-syn\fR

.sp
Another common type of firewall uses stateful rules that drop unexpected packets\&. This feature was initially found mostly on high\-end firewalls, though it has become much more common over the years\&. The Linux Netfilter/iptables system supports this through the

Many other types of ICMP errors, such as host/network unreachables or TTL exceeded are indicative of a down or unreachable host\&. A lack of response is also interpreted this way\&.

A few services, such as the Character Generator (chargen) protocol, will respond to an empty UDP packet, and thus disclose to Nmap that the machine is available\&.

TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option\&. This is the case when a user does not have raw packet privileges\&.

system call\&. This is the same high\-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other network\-enabled applications use to establish a connection\&. It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API\&.

When SYN scan is available, it is usually a better choice\&. Nmap has less control over the high level

call than with raw packets, making it less efficient\&. The system call completes connections to open target ports rather than performing the half\-open reset that SYN scan does\&.

UDP scan works by sending a UDP packet to every targeted port\&. For some common ports such as 53 and 161, a protocol\-specific payload is sent to increase response rate, but for most ports the packet is empty unless the
\fB\-\-data\fR,
\fB\-\-data\-string\fR, or
\fB\-\-data\-length\fR
options are specified\&. If an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned, the port is
closed\&. Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, codes 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13) mark the port as
filtered\&. Occasionally, a service will respond with a UDP packet, proving that it is
open\&. If no response is received after retransmissions, the port is classified as
open|filtered\&. This means that the port could be open, or perhaps packet filters are blocking the communication\&. Version detection (\fB\-sV\fR) can be used to help differentiate the truly open ports from the filtered ones\&.
.sp
A big challenge with UDP scanning is doing it quickly\&. Open and filtered ports rarely send any response, leaving Nmap to time out and then conduct retransmissions just in case the probe or response were lost\&. Closed ports are often an even bigger problem\&. They usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error\&. But unlike the RST packets sent by closed TCP ports in response to a SYN or connect scan, many hosts rate limit
.\" rate limiting
ICMP port unreachable messages by default\&. Linux and Solaris are particularly strict about this\&. For example, the Linux 2\&.4\&.20 kernel limits destination unreachable messages to one per second (in
net/ipv4/icmp\&.c)\&.
.sp
Nmap detects rate limiting and slows down accordingly to avoid flooding the network with useless packets that the target machine will drop\&. Unfortunately, a Linux\-style limit of one packet per second makes a 65,536\-port scan take more than 18 hours\&. Ideas for speeding your UDP scans up include scanning more hosts in parallel, doing a quick scan of just the popular ports first, scanning from behind the firewall, and using
\fB\-\-host\-timeout\fR

It is mostly being used for SS7/SIGTRAN related services but has the potential to be used for other applications as well\&. SCTP INIT scan is the SCTP equivalent of a TCP SYN scan\&. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls\&.

This technique is often referred to as half\-open scanning, because you don\*(Aqt open a full SCTP association\&.

\(lqyou are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the segment, and return\&.\(rq

When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a returned RST if the port is closed and no response at all if the port is open\&.

These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except for the TCP flags set in probe packets\&. If a RST packet is received, the port is considered

Nmap sends a series of TCP and UDP packets to the remote host and examines practically every bit in the responses\&. After performing dozens of tests such as TCP ISN sampling, TCP options support and ordering, IP ID sampling, and the initial window size check, Nmap compares the results to its
nmap\-os\-db
.\" nmap-os-db
database of more than 2,600 known OS fingerprints and prints out the OS details if there is a match\&. Each fingerprint includes a freeform textual description of the OS, and a classification which provides the vendor name (e\&.g\&. Sun), underlying OS (e\&.g\&. Solaris), OS generation (e\&.g\&. 10), and device type (general purpose, router, switch, game console, etc)\&. Most fingerprints also have a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
.\" Common Platform Enumeration: operating system
representation, like
cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2\&.6\&.
.PP
If Nmap is unable to guess the OS of a machine, and conditions are good (e\&.g\&. at least one open port and one closed port were found), Nmap will provide a URL you can use to submit the fingerprint if you know (for sure) the OS running on the machine\&. By doing this you contribute to the pool of operating systems known to Nmap and thus it will be more accurate for everyone\&.
.PP
OS detection enables some other tests which make use of information that is gathered during the process anyway\&. One of these is TCP Sequence Predictability Classification\&. This measures approximately how hard it is to establish a forged TCP connection against the remote host\&. It is useful for exploiting source\-IP based trust relationships (rlogin, firewall filters, etc) or for hiding the source of an attack\&. This sort of spoofing is rarely performed any more, but many machines are still vulnerable to it\&. The actual difficulty number is based on statistical sampling and may fluctuate\&. It is generally better to use the English classification such as
\(lqworthy challenge\(rq
or
\(lqtrivial joke\(rq\&. This is only reported in normal output in verbose (\fB\-v\fR) mode\&. When verbose mode is enabled along with
\fB\-O\fR, IP ID sequence generation is also reported\&. Most machines are in the
\(lqincremental\(rq
class, which means that they increment the ID field in the IP header for each packet they send\&. This makes them vulnerable to several advanced information gathering and spoofing attacks\&.
.\" uptime guess
.PP
Another bit of extra information enabled by OS detection is a guess at a target\*(Aqs uptime\&. This uses the TCP timestamp option (\m[blue]\fBRFC 1323\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2) to guess when a machine was last rebooted\&. The guess can be inaccurate due to the timestamp counter not being initialized to zero or the counter overflowing and wrapping around, so it is printed only in verbose mode\&.

\fB\-\-max\-os\-tries\fR
value (such as 1) speeds Nmap up, though you miss out on retries which could potentially identify the OS\&.

That is barely enough time to blink, but adds up when you are scanning hundreds or thousands of hosts\&.

Nmap has the ability to port scan or version scan multiple hosts in parallel\&. Nmap does this by dividing the target IP space into groups and then scanning one group at a time\&. In general, larger groups are more efficient\&. The downside is that host results can\*(Aqt be provided until the whole group is finished\&. So if Nmap started out with a group size of 50, the user would not receive any reports (except for the updates offered in verbose mode) until the first 50 hosts are completed\&.

By default, Nmap takes a compromise approach to this conflict\&. It starts out with a group size as low as five so the first results come quickly and then increases the groupsize to as high as 1024\&. The exact default numbers depend on the options given\&. For efficiency reasons, Nmap uses larger group sizes for UDP or few\-port TCP scans\&.
.sp
When a maximum group size is specified with
\fB\-\-max\-hostgroup\fR, Nmap will never exceed that size\&. Specify a minimum size with

Nmap\*(Aqs dynamic timing does a good job of finding an appropriate speed at which to scan\&.

.sp
When the

These two options are global, affecting an entire scan, not individual hosts\&. They only affect port scans and host discovery scans\&. Other features like OS detection implement their own timing\&.
.sp
There are two conditions when the actual scanning rate may fall below the requested minimum\&. The first is if the minimum is faster than the fastest rate at which Nmap can send, which is dependent on hardware\&. In this case Nmap will simply send packets as fast as possible, but be aware that such high rates are likely to cause a loss of accuracy\&. The second case is when Nmap has nothing to send, for example at the end of a scan when the last probes have been sent and Nmap is waiting for them to time out or be responded to\&. It\*(Aqs normal to see the scanning rate drop at the end of a scan or in between hostgroups\&. The sending rate may temporarily exceed the maximum to make up for unpredictable delays, but on average the rate will stay at or below the maximum\&.

While the fine\-grained timing controls discussed in the previous section are powerful and effective, some people find them confusing\&. Moreover, choosing the appropriate values can sometimes take more time than the scan you are trying to optimize\&. So Nmap offers a simpler approach, with six timing templates\&. You can specify them with the
\fB\-T\fR

\fBparanoid\fR\ \&(\fB0\fR),
\fBsneaky\fR\ \&(\fB1\fR),

\fBnormal\fR\ \&(\fB3\fR),
\fBaggressive\fR\ \&(\fB4\fR), and
\fBinsane\fR\ \&(\fB5\fR)\&. The first two are for IDS evasion\&. Polite mode slows down the scan to use less bandwidth and target machine resources\&. Normal mode is the default and so
\fB\-T3\fR
does nothing\&. Aggressive mode speeds scans up by making the assumption that you are on a reasonably fast and reliable network\&. Finally insane mode
.\" insane (-T5) timing template
assumes that you are on an extraordinarily fast network or are willing to sacrifice some accuracy for speed\&.
.sp
These templates allow the user to specify how aggressive they wish to be, while leaving Nmap to pick the exact timing values\&. The templates also make some minor speed adjustments for which fine\-grained control options do not currently exist\&. For example,
\fB\-T4\fR
.\" aggressive (-T4) timing template
prohibits the dynamic scan delay from exceeding 10\ \&ms for TCP ports and
\fB\-T5\fR
caps that value at 5\ \&ms\&. Templates can be used in combination with fine\-grained controls, and the fine\-grained controls will you specify will take precedence over the timing template default for that parameter\&. I recommend using
\fB\-T4\fR
when scanning reasonably modern and reliable networks\&. Keep that option even when you add fine\-grained controls so that you benefit from those extra minor optimizations that it enables\&.
.sp
If you are on a decent broadband or ethernet connection, I would recommend always using

\fB\-T5\fR

\fB\-T polite\fR
.\" polite (-T2) timing template
really is\&. Their scan may take ten times longer than a default scan\&. Machine crashes and bandwidth problems are rare with the default timing options (\fB\-T3\fR) and so I normally recommend that for cautious scanners\&.

.SH "FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING"
.\" firewalls: bypassing
.\" intrusion detection systems: evading
.PP
Many Internet pioneers envisioned a global open network with a universal IP address space allowing virtual connections between any two nodes\&. This allows hosts to act as true peers, serving and retrieving information from each other\&. People could access all of their home systems from work, changing the climate control settings or unlocking the doors for early guests\&. This vision of universal connectivity has been stifled by address space shortages and security concerns\&. In the early 1990s, organizations began deploying firewalls for the express purpose of reducing connectivity\&. Huge networks were cordoned off from the unfiltered Internet by application proxies, network address translation, and packet filters\&. The unrestricted flow of information gave way to tight regulation of approved communication channels and the content that passes over them\&.
.PP
Network obstructions such as firewalls can make mapping a network exceedingly difficult\&. It will not get any easier, as stifling casual reconnaissance is often a key goal of implementing the devices\&. Nevertheless, Nmap offers many features to help understand these complex networks, and to verify that filters are working as intended\&. It even supports mechanisms for bypassing poorly implemented defenses\&. One of the best methods of understanding your network security posture is to try to defeat it\&. Place yourself in the mind\-set of an attacker, and deploy techniques from this section against your networks\&. Launch an FTP bounce scan, idle scan, fragmentation attack, or try to tunnel through one of your own proxies\&.
.PP
In addition to restricting network activity, companies are increasingly monitoring traffic with intrusion detection systems (IDS)\&. All of the major IDSs ship with rules designed to detect Nmap scans because scans are sometimes a precursor to attacks\&. Many of these products have recently morphed into intrusion
\fIprevention\fR
systems (IPS)
.\" intrusion prevention systems
that actively block traffic deemed malicious\&. Unfortunately for network administrators and IDS vendors, reliably detecting bad intentions by analyzing packet data is a tough problem\&. Attackers with patience, skill, and the help of certain Nmap options can usually pass by IDSs undetected\&. Meanwhile, administrators must cope with large numbers of false positive results where innocent activity is misdiagnosed and alerted on or blocked\&.
.PP
Occasionally people suggest that Nmap should not offer features for evading firewall rules or sneaking past IDSs\&. They argue that these features are just as likely to be misused by attackers as used by administrators to enhance security\&. The problem with this logic is that these methods would still be used by attackers, who would just find other tools or patch the functionality into Nmap\&. Meanwhile, administrators would find it that much harder to do their jobs\&. Deploying only modern, patched FTP servers is a far more powerful defense than trying to prevent the distribution of tools implementing the FTP bounce attack\&.

There is no magic bullet (or Nmap option) for detecting and subverting firewalls and IDS systems\&. It takes skill and experience\&. A tutorial is beyond the scope of this reference guide, which only lists the relevant options and describes what they do\&.

Be careful with this! Some programs have trouble handling these tiny packets\&. The old\-school sniffer named Sniffit segmentation faulted immediately upon receiving the first fragment\&. Specify this option once, and Nmap splits the packets into eight bytes or less after the IP header\&. So a 20\-byte TCP header would be split into three packets\&.

Note that the hosts you use as decoys should be up or you might accidentally SYN flood your targets\&.

Decoys are used both in the initial ping scan (using ICMP, SYN, ACK, or whatever) and during the actual port scanning phase\&. Decoys are also used during remote OS detection (\fB\-O\fR)\&.

One surprisingly common misconfiguration is to trust traffic based only on the source port number\&. It is easy to understand how this comes about\&. An administrator will set up a shiny new firewall, only to be flooded with complaints from ungrateful users whose applications stopped working\&. In particular, DNS may be broken because the UDP DNS replies from external servers can no longer enter the network\&. FTP is another common example\&. In active FTP transfers, the remote server tries to establish a connection back to the client to transfer the requested file\&.
.sp
Secure solutions to these problems exist, often in the form of application\-level proxies or protocol\-parsing firewall modules\&. Unfortunately there are also easier, insecure solutions\&. Noting that DNS replies come from port 53 and active FTP from port 20, many administrators have fallen into the trap of simply allowing incoming traffic from those ports\&. They often assume that no attacker would notice and exploit such firewall holes\&. In other cases, administrators consider this a short\-term stop\-gap measure until they can implement a more secure solution\&. Then they forget the security upgrade\&.
.sp
Overworked network administrators are not the only ones to fall into this trap\&. Numerous products have shipped with these insecure rules\&. Even Microsoft has been guilty\&. The IPsec filters that shipped with Windows 2000 and Windows XP contain an implicit rule that allows all TCP or UDP traffic from port 88 (Kerberos)\&.

for brevity, more descriptive names are generally recommended\&. The names chosen are a matter of personal preference, though I use long ones that incorporate the scan date and a word or two describing the scan, placed in a directory named after the company I\*(Aqm scanning\&.
.PP
While these options save results to files, Nmap still prints interactive output to stdout as usual\&. For example, the command
\fBnmap \-oX myscan\&.xml target\fR
prints XML to
myscan\&.xml
and fills standard output with the same interactive results it would have printed if
\fB\-oX\fR
wasn\*(Aqt specified at all\&. You can change this by passing a hyphen character as the argument to one of the format types\&. This causes Nmap to deactivate interactive output, and instead print results in the format you specified to the standard output stream\&. So the command
\fBnmap \-oX \- target\fR
will send only XML output to stdout\&.
.\" output: to stdout with -

Unlike some Nmap arguments, the space between the logfile option flag (such as
\fB\-oX\fR) and the filename or hyphen is mandatory\&. If you omit the flags and give arguments such as
\fB\-oG\-\fR
or
\fB\-oXscan\&.xml\fR, a backwards compatibility feature of Nmap will cause the creation of
\fInormal format\fR
output files named
G\-

Xscan\&.xml
respectively\&.

.RS 4
Requests that XML output be directed to the given filename\&. Nmap includes a document type definition (DTD) which allows XML parsers to validate Nmap XML output\&. While it is primarily intended for programmatic use, it can also help humans interpret Nmap XML output\&. The DTD defines the legal elements of the format, and often enumerates the attributes and values they can take on\&. The latest version is always available from
\m[blue]\fB\%https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/docs/nmap.dtd\fR\m[]\&.
.sp
XML offers a stable format that is easily parsed by software\&. Free XML parsers are available for all major computer languages, including C/C++, Perl, Python, and Java\&. People have even written bindings for most of these languages to handle Nmap output and execution specifically\&. Examples are
\m[blue]\fBNmap::Scanner\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[15]\d\s+2

.sp
The XML output references an XSL stylesheet which can be used to format the results as HTML\&. The easiest way to use this is simply to load the XML output in a web browser such as Firefox or IE\&. By default, this will only work on the machine you ran Nmap on (or a similarly configured one) due to the hard\-coded

This output format is covered last because it is deprecated\&. The XML output format is far more powerful, and is nearly as convenient for experienced users\&. XML is a standard for which dozens of excellent parsers are available, while grepable output is my own simple hack\&. XML is extensible to support new Nmap features as they are released, while I often must omit those features from grepable output for lack of a place to put them\&.
.sp
Nevertheless, grepable output is still quite popular\&. It is a simple format that lists each host on one line and can be trivially searched and parsed with standard Unix tools such as grep, awk, cut, sed, diff, and Perl\&. Even I usually use it for one\-off tests done at the command line\&. Finding all the hosts with the SSH port open or that are running Solaris takes only a simple grep to identify the hosts, piped to an awk or cut command to print the desired fields\&.
.sp
Grepable output consists of comments (lines starting with a pound (#))
.\" grepable output: comments in
and target lines\&. A target line includes a combination of six labeled fields, separated by tabs and followed with a colon\&. The fields are
Host,
Ports,
Protocols,
Ignored State,
OS,
Seq Index,
IP ID, and
Status\&.
.sp
The most important of these fields is generally
Ports, which gives details on each interesting port\&. It is a comma separated list of port entries\&. Each port entry represents one interesting port, and takes the form of seven slash (/) separated subfields\&. Those subfields are:
Port number,
State,
Protocol,
Owner,
Service,
SunRPC info, and
Version info\&.

Most changes only affect interactive output, and some also affect normal and script kiddie output\&.

This tests whether the systems run SSH, DNS, POP3, or IMAP on their standard ports, or anything on port 4564\&. For any of these ports found open, version detection is used to determine what application is running\&.

Asks Nmap to choose 100,000 hosts at random and scan them for web servers (port 80)\&. Host enumeration is disabled with

.SH "NMAP BOOK"
.PP
While this reference guide details all material Nmap options, it can\*(Aqt fully demonstrate how to apply those features to quickly solve real\-world tasks\&. For that, we released
Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning\&.
Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems, optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine\&. Hints and instructions are provided for common Nmap tasks such as taking network inventory, penetration testing, detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm outbreaks\&. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on the wire\&. More than half of the book is available free online\&. See
\m[blue]\fB\%https://nmap.org/book\fR\m[]
for more information\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.\" bugs, reporting
.PP
Like its author, Nmap isn\*(Aqt perfect\&. But you can help make it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches\&. If Nmap doesn\*(Aqt behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from
\m[blue]\fB\%https://nmap.org\fR\m[]\&. If the problem persists, do some research to determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed\&. Try searching for the error message on our search page at
\m[blue]\fB\%http://insecure.org/search.html\fR\m[]
or at Google\&. Also try browsing the
nmap\-dev
archives at
\m[blue]\fB\%http://seclists.org/\fR\m[]\&.

Read this full manual page as well\&. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
<dev@nmap\&.org>\&. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of Nmap you are running and what operating system version it is running on\&. Problem reports and Nmap usage questions sent to
<dev@nmap\&.org>
are far more likely to be answered than those sent to Fyodor directly\&. If you subscribe to the nmap\-dev list before posting, your message will bypass moderation and get through more quickly\&. Subscribe at

This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples\&. Other people may interpret the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to the GPL that we apply to Covered Software\&. Works which meet any of these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license, particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole\&.
.PP
As another special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure\&.Com LLC grants permission to link the code of this program with any version of the OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that listed in the included
docs/licenses/OpenSSL\&.txt
file, and distribute linked combinations including the two\&.
.\" OpenSSL: linking exception
.PP
Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works, must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including obeying all GPL rules and restrictions\&. For example, source code of the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be allowed\&. All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as including the terms and conditions of this license text as well\&.
.PP
Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL software\&. The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must be included as well\&. This license is incompatible with some other open source licenses as well\&. In some cases we can relicense portions of Nmap or grant special permissions to use it in other open source software\&. Please contact fyodor@nmap\&.org with any such requests\&. Similarly, we don\*(Aqt incorporate incompatible open source software into Covered Software without special permission from the copyright holders\&.
.PP
If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using Nmap in other works, are happy to help\&. As mentioned above, we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary applications and appliances\&. These contracts have been sold to dozens of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well as providing for priority support and updates\&. They also fund the continued development of Nmap\&. Please email
<sales@nmap\&.com>
for further information\&.

If you have received a written license agreement or contract for Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these\&.

\m[blue]\fBCreative Commons Attribution License\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[19]\d\s+2\&. This allows you redistribute and modify the work as you desire, as long as you credit the original source\&. Alternatively, you may choose to treat this document as falling under the same license as Nmap itself (discussed previously)\&.
.SS "Source Code Availability and Community Contributions"
.PP
Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it\&. This also allows you to audit the software for security holes\&.
.PP
Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and add new features\&. You are highly encouraged to send your changes to
<dev@nmap\&.org>
for possible incorporation into the main distribution\&. By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the Insecure\&.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are offering the Nmap Project (Insecure\&.Com LLC) the unlimited, non\-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code\&. Nmap will always be available open source,
.\" open source
but this is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM)\&.

It should also be noted that Nmap has occasionally been known to crash poorly written applications, TCP/IP stacks, and even operating systems\&.
.\" crashing targets
While this is extremely rare, it is important to keep in mind\&.
\fINmap should never be run against mission critical systems\fR
unless you are prepared to suffer downtime\&. We acknowledge here that Nmap may crash your systems or networks and we disclaim all liability for any damage or problems Nmap could cause\&.
.SS "Inappropriate Usage"
.PP
Because of the slight risk of crashes and because a few black hats like to use Nmap for reconnaissance prior to attacking systems, there are administrators who become upset and may complain when their system is scanned\&. Thus, it is often advisable to request permission before doing even a light scan of a network\&.
.PP
Nmap should never be installed with special privileges (e\&.g\&. suid root)\&.
.\" setuid, why Nmap shouldn't be.\" suid
That would open up a major security vulnerability as other users on the system (or attackers) could use it for privilege escalation\&.
