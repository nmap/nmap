    <para>Nmap (<quote>Network Mapper</quote>) is an open source tool for network
    exploration and security auditing.  It was designed to rapidly
    scan large networks, although it works fine against single
    hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
    hosts are available on the network, what services (application
    name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
    (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
    filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
    characteristics.  While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
    many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
    tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
    schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.</para>

    <para>The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
    supplemental information on each depending on the options
    used. Key among that information is the <quote>interesting ports
    table</quote>.  That table lists the port number and protocol,
    service name, and state.  The state is either
    <literal>open</literal>, <literal>filtered</literal>,
    <literal>closed</literal>, or <literal>unfiltered</literal>. Open
    means that an application on the target machine is listening for
    connections/packets on that port. <literal>Filtered</literal> means that a firewall,
    filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that
    Nmap cannot tell whether it is <literal>open</literal> or <literal>closed</literal>.  <literal>Closed</literal> ports have
    no application listening on them, though they could open up at any
    time.  Ports are classified as <literal>unfiltered</literal> when they are responsive
    to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open
    or closed.  Nmap reports the state combinations
    <literal>open|filtered</literal> and
    <literal>closed|filtered</literal> when it cannot determine which
    of the two states describe a port.  The port table may also
    include software version details when version detection has been
    requested.  When an IP protocol scan is requested
    (<option>-sO</option>), Nmap provides information on supported IP
    protocols rather than listening ports.</para>

    <para>In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
    further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
    operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.</para>

    <para>A typical Nmap scan is shown in <xref
    linkend="man-ex-repscan" />.  The only Nmap arguments used in
    this example are <option>-A</option>, to enable OS and version
    detection, script scanning, and traceroute; <option>-T4</option> for
    faster execution; and then the two target hostnames.</para>

  <refsect1 id='man-target-specification'>
    <title>Target Specification</title>

<para>Everything on the Nmap command-line that isn't an option (or
option argument) is treated as a target host specification.  The
simplest case is to specify a target IP address or hostname for scanning.</para>

<para>Sometimes you wish to scan a whole network of adjacent hosts.
For this, Nmap supports CIDR-style addressing.  You can append<indexterm><primary>CIDR addressing</primary></indexterm>
/<replaceable>numbits</replaceable> to an IP address or hostname and
Nmap will scan every IP address for which the first
<replaceable>numbits</replaceable> are the same as for the reference
IP or hostname given.  For example, 192.168.10.0/24 would scan the 256
hosts between 192.168.10.0 (binary: <literal>11000000 10101000
00001010 00000000</literal>) and 192.168.10.255 (binary: <literal>11000000 10101000
00001010 11111111</literal>), inclusive.
192.168.10.40/24 would do exactly the same thing.  Given that the host
scanme.nmap.org is at the IP address 205.217.153.62, the specification
scanme.nmap.org/16 would scan the 65,536 IP addresses between
205.217.0.0 and 205.217.255.255.  The smallest allowed value is /1,
which scans half the Internet.  The largest value is 32, which scans
just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed.</para>

<para>CIDR notation is short but not always flexible enough.  For example, you
might want to scan 192.168.0.0/16 but skip any IPs ending with .0 or
.255 because they are commonly broadcast addresses.  Nmap supports
this through octet range addressing.  Rather than specify a normal IP
address, you can specify a comma separated list of numbers or ranges
for each octet.  For example, 192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all
addresses in the range that end in .0 and or .255.  Ranges need not be
limited to the final octets: the specifier
0-255.0-255.13.37 will perform an Internet-wide scan for all IP
addresses ending in 13.37.  This sort of broad sampling can be useful
for Internet surveys and research.</para>

<para>IPv6 addresses can only be specified by their fully qualified IPv6
address or hostname.  CIDR and octet ranges aren't supported for
IPv6 because they are rarely useful.</para>

<para>Nmap accepts multiple host specifications on the command line,
and they don't need to be the same type.  The command <command>nmap
scanme.nmap.org 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0,1,3-7.0-255</command> does what
you would expect.</para>

<para>While targets are usually specified on the command lines, the following options are also available to control target selection:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <option>-iL &lt;inputfilename&gt;</option> (Input from list)

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Reads target specifications from
          <replaceable>inputfilename</replaceable>.  Passing a huge
          list of hosts is often awkward on the command line, yet it
          is a common desire.  For example, your DHCP server might
          export a list of 10,000 current leases that you wish to
          scan.  Or maybe you want to scan all IP addresses
          <emphasis>except</emphasis> for those to locate hosts using
          unauthorized static IP addresses.  Simply generate the list
          of hosts to scan and pass that filename to Nmap as an
          argument to the <option>-iL</option> option.  Entries can be
          in any of the formats accepted by Nmap on the command line
          (IP address, hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or octet ranges).  Each
          entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or
          newlines.  You can specify a hyphen (<literal>-</literal>)
          as the filename if you want Nmap to read hosts from standard
          input rather than an actual file.</para>
        </listitem>

      <varlistentry>

        <listitem>
          <para>For Internet-wide surveys
          and other research, you may want to choose targets at
          random.  The <replaceable>num hosts</replaceable> argument
          tells Nmap how many IPs to generate.  Undesirable IPs such
          as those in certain private, multicast, or unallocated
          address ranges are automatically skipped.  The argument <literal>0</literal>
          can be specified for a never-ending scan.  Keep in mind that
          some network administrators bristle at unauthorized scans of
          their networks and may complain.  Use this option at your
          own risk!  If you find yourself really bored one rainy

          octet ranges, etc.  This can be useful when the network you
          wish to scan includes untouchable mission-critical servers,

  <refsect1 id='man-host-discovery'>
    <title>Host Discovery</title>
 
   <para>One of the very first steps in any network reconnaissance
    mission is to reduce a (sometimes huge) set of IP ranges into a
    list of active or interesting hosts. Scanning every port of
    every single IP address is slow and usually unnecessary. Of
    course what makes a host interesting depends greatly on the
    scan purposes. Network administrators may only be interested in
    hosts running a certain service, while security auditors may
    care about every single device with an IP address. An
    administrator may be comfortable using just an ICMP ping to
    locate hosts on his internal network, while an external
    penetration tester may use a diverse set of dozens of probes in
    an attempt to evade firewall restrictions.</para>

    <para>Because host discovery needs are so diverse, Nmap offers a
    wide variety of options for customizing the techniques used. Host
    discovery is sometimes called ping scan, but it goes well beyond
    the simple ICMP echo request packets associated with the
    ubiquitous <application>ping</application> tool. Users can skip
    the ping step entirely with a list scan (<option>-sL</option>) or
    by disabling ping (<option>-P0</option>), or engage the network
    with arbitrary combinations of multi-port TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, and
    ICMP probes. The goal of these probes is to solicit responses
    which demonstrate that an IP address is actually active (is being
    used by a host or network device). On many networks, only a small
    percentage of IP addresses are active at any given time. This is
    particularly common with RFC1918-blessed private address space
    such as 10.0.0.0/8. That network has 16 million IPs, but I have
    seen it used by companies with less than a thousand machines. Host
    discovery can find those machines in a sparsely allocated sea of
    IP addresses.</para>

    <para>If no host discovery options are given, Nmap
          sends a TCP ACK
          packet destined for port 80 and an ICMP echo request query
          to each target machine.  An exception to this is that an ARP scan is
          used for any targets which are on a local ethernet network.
          For unprivileged Unix shell users, a SYN packet is sent
          instead of the ack using the <function>connect()</function>
          system call.  These defaults are equivalent to the
          <option>-PA -PE</option> options.  This host discovery is
          often sufficient when scanning local networks, but a more
          comprehensive set of discovery probes is recommended for
          security auditing.</para>
    
    <para>The <option>-P*</option> options (which select
    ping types) can be combined.  You can increase your odds of
    penetrating strict firewalls by sending many probe types using
    different TCP ports/flags and ICMP codes.  Also note that ARP
    discovery (<option>-PR</option>) is done by default against
    targets on a local ethernet network even if you specify other
    <option>-P*</option> options, because it is almost always faster
    and more effective.</para>

    <para>By default, Nmap does host discovery and then performs a
    port scan against each host it determines is online.  This is true
    even if you specify non-default host discovery types such as UDP
    probes (<option>-PU</option>).  Read about the
    <option>-sP</option> option to learn how to perform
    <emphasis>only</emphasis> host discovery, or use
    <option>-P0</option> to skip host discovery and port scan all
    target hosts.  The following options control host
    discovery:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
        <option>-sL</option> (List Scan)
          <indexterm><primary>-sL</primary></indexterm>
          <indexterm><primary>List scan</primary></indexterm>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The list scan is a degenerate form of host discovery
          that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified,
          without sending any packets to the target hosts.  By
          default, Nmap still does reverse-DNS resolution on the hosts
          to learn their names.  It is often surprising how much
          useful information simple hostnames give out.  For example,
          <literal>fw.chi</literal> is the name of one company's Chicago firewall. 
          Nmap also reports the total number of
          IP addresses at the end.  The list scan is a good sanity
          check to ensure that you have proper IP addresses for your
          targets.  If the hosts sport domain names you do not
          recognize, it is worth investigating further to prevent
          scanning the wrong company's network.</para>

          <para>Since the idea is to simply print a list of target
          hosts, options for higher level functionality such as port
          scanning, OS detection, or ping scanning cannot be combined
          with this.  If you wish to disable ping scanning while still
          performing such higher level functionality, read up on the
          <option>-P0</option> option.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
        <option>-sP</option> (Ping Scan)</term>
        <listitem>
           <para>This option tells Nmap to <emphasis>only</emphasis><indexterm><primary>-sP</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>ping scan</primary></indexterm>
           perform a ping scan (host discovery), then print out the available hosts
           that responded to the scan.  No further testing (such as
           port scanning or OS detection) is performed.  This is one
           step more intrusive than the list scan, and can often be
           used for the same purposes.  It allows light reconnaissance
           of a target network without attracting much attention.
           Knowing how many hosts are up is more valuable to attackers
           than the list provided by list scan of every single IP and host name.</para>

           <para>Systems administrators often find this option
           valuable as well.  It can easily be used to count available
           machines on a network or monitor server availability.  This
           is often called a ping sweep, and is more reliable than
           pinging the broadcast address because many hosts do not
           reply to broadcast queries.</para>

           <para>The <option>-sP</option> option sends an ICMP echo
           request and a TCP packet to port 80 by default.  When
           executed by an unprivileged user, only a SYN packet is sent
           (using a <function>connect()</function> call) to port 80 on
           the target.  When a privileged user tries to scan targets
           on a local ethernet network, ARP requests
           (<option>-PR</option>) are used unless
           <option>--send-ip</option> was specified.
           The <option>-sP</option> option can be combined with any of the
           discovery probe types (the <option>-P*</option> options,
           excluding <option>-P0</option>) for greater flexibility.
           If any of those probe type and port number options are
           used, the default probes (ACK and echo request) are
           overridden.  When strict firewalls are in place between the
           source host running Nmap and the target network, using
           those advanced techniques is recommended.  Otherwise hosts
           could be missed when the firewall drops probes or their
           responses.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>This option skips the Nmap discovery stage altogether.
          Normally, Nmap uses this stage to determine active machines
          for heavier scanning.  By default, Nmap only performs heavy
          probing such as port scans, version detection, or OS
          detection against hosts that are found to be up.  Disabling
          host discovery with <option>-P0</option> causes Nmap to
          attempt the requested scanning functions against
          <emphasis>every</emphasis> target IP address specified.  So
          if a class B sized target address space (/16) is specified
          on the command line, all 65,536 IP addresses are scanned.
          That second option character in <option>-P0</option> is a
          zero and not the letter O.  Proper host discovery is skipped
          as with the list scan, but instead of stopping and printing
          the target list, Nmap continues to perform requested
          functions as if each target IP is active.</para>

          specified as a parameter.  A comma separated list of ports
          can even be specified
          (e.g. <option>-PS22,23,25,80,113,1050,35000</option>), in

          <para>The SYN flag suggests to the remote system that you
          are attempting to establish a connection.  Normally the
          destination port will be closed, and a RST (reset) packet
          sent back.  If the port happens to be open, the target will
          take the second step of a TCP 3-way-handshake by responding
          with a SYN/ACK TCP packet. The machine running Nmap then
          tears down the nascent connection by responding with a RST
          rather than sending an ACK packet which would complete the
          3-way-handshake and establish a full
          connection.  The RST packet is sent by the
          kernel of the machine running Nmap in response to the
          unexpected SYN/ACK, not by Nmap itself.</para>

          <para>Nmap does not care whether the port is open or closed.
          Either the RST or SYN/ACK response discussed previously tell
          Nmap that the host is available and responsive.</para>

          <para>On Unix boxes, only the privileged user
          <literal>root</literal> is generally able to send and
          receive raw TCP packets.  For unprivileged users, a
          workaround is automatically employed whereby the connect()
          system call is initiated against each target port.  This has
          the effect of sending a SYN packet to the target host, in an
          attempt to establish a connection.  If connect() returns
          with a quick success or an ECONNREFUSED failure, the
          underlying TCP stack must have received a SYN/ACK or RST and
          the host is marked available.  If the connection attempt
          is left hanging until a timeout is reached, the host is
          marked as down.  This workaround is also used for IPv6
          connections, as raw IPv6 packet building support is not yet
          available in Nmap.</para>

          <para>The TCP ACK ping is quite similar to the
          just-discussed SYN ping.  The difference, as you could
          likely guess, is that the TCP ACK flag is set instead of the
          SYN flag.  Such an ACK packet purports to be acknowledging
          data over an established TCP connection, but no such
          connection exists.  So remote hosts should always respond
          with a RST packet, disclosing their existence in the
          process.</para>

          <para>The <option>-PA</option> option uses the same default
          port as the SYN probe (80) and can also take a list of
          destination ports in the same format.  If an unprivileged
          user tries this, or an IPv6 target is specified, the
          connect() workaround discussed previously is used.  This
          workaround is imperfect because connect() is actually
          sending a SYN packet rather than an ACK.</para>

          <para>The reason for offering both SYN and ACK ping probes
          is to maximize the chances of bypassing firewalls.  Many
          administrators configure routers and other simple firewalls
          to block incoming SYN packets except for those destined for
          public services like the company web site or mail server.
          This prevents other incoming connections to the
          organization, while allowing users to make unobstructed
          outgoing connections to the Internet.  This non-stateful
          approach takes up few resources on the firewall/router and
          is widely supported by hardware and software filters.  The
          Linux Netfilter/iptables firewall software offers the
          <option>--syn</option> convenience option to implement this
          stateless approach.  When stateless firewall rules such as
          this are in place, SYN ping probes (<option>-PS</option>)
          are likely to be blocked when sent to closed target ports.
          In such cases, the ACK probe shines as it cuts right through
          these rules.</para>

          <para>Another common type of firewall uses stateful rules
          that drop unexpected packets.  This feature was initially
          found mostly on high-end firewalls, though it has become
          much more common over the years.  The Linux
          Netfilter/iptables system supports this through the
          <option>--state</option> option, which categorizes packets
          based on connection state.  A SYN probe is more likely to
          work against such a system, as unexpected ACK packets are
          generally recognized as bogus and dropped.  A solution to this quandary is
          to send both SYN and ACK probes by specifying
          <option>-PS</option> and <option>-PA</option>.</para>

          <para>Another host discovery option is the UDP ping, which
          sends an empty (unless <option>--data-length</option> is
          specified) UDP packet to the given ports.  The portlist
          takes the same format as with the previously discussed
          <option>-PS</option> and <option>-PA</option> options.  If
          no ports are specified, the default is 31338.  This default
          can be configured at compile-time by changing
          DEFAULT_UDP_PROBE_PORT in <filename>nmap.h</filename>.  A
          highly uncommon port is used by default because sending to
          open ports is often undesirable for this particular scan
          type.</para>

          <para>Upon hitting a closed port on the target machine, the
          UDP probe should elicit an ICMP port unreachable packet in
          return.  This signifies to Nmap that the machine is up and
          available.  Many other types of ICMP errors, such as
          host/network unreachables or TTL exceeded are indicative of
          a down or unreachable host.  A lack of response is also
          interpreted this way.  If an open port is reached, most
          services simply ignore the empty packet and fail to return
          any response.  This is why the default probe port is 31338,
          which is highly unlikely to be in use.  A few services, such
          as chargen, will respond to an empty UDP packet, and thus
          disclose to Nmap that the machine is available.</para>

          <para>The primary advantage of this scan type is that it
          bypasses firewalls and filters that only screen TCP.  For
          example, I once owned a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless broadband
          router.  The external interface of this device filtered all
          TCP ports by default, but UDP probes would still elicit port
          unreachable messages and thus give away the device.</para>

          <para>In addition to the unusual TCP and UDP host discovery
          types discussed previously, Nmap can send the standard
          packets sent by the ubiquitous
          <application>ping</application> program.  Nmap sends an ICMP
          type 8 (echo request) packet to the target IP addresses,
          expecting a type 0 (echo reply) in return from available
          hosts.  Unfortunately for network explorers, many hosts and
          firewalls now block these packets, rather than responding as
          required by <ulink
          url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC
          1122</ulink>.  For this reason, ICMP-only scans are rarely
          reliable enough against unknown targets over the Internet.
          But for system administrators monitoring an internal
          network, they can be a practical and efficient approach.
          Use the <option>-PE</option> option to enable this echo
          request behavior.</para>

          <para>While echo request is the standard ICMP ping query,
          Nmap does not stop there.  The ICMP standard (<ulink
          url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792.txt">RFC
          792</ulink>) also specifies timestamp request, information
          request, and address mask request packets as codes 13, 15,
          and 17, respectively.  While the ostensible purpose for
          these queries is to learn information such as address masks
          and current times, they can easily be used for host
          discovery.  A system that replies is up and available.  Nmap
          does not currently implement information request packets, as
          they are not widely supported.  RFC 1122 insists that
          <quote>a host SHOULD NOT implement these messages</quote>.
          Timestamp and address mask queries can be sent with the
          <option>-PP</option> and <option>-PM</option> options,
          respectively.  A timestamp reply (ICMP code 14) or address
          mask reply (code 18) discloses that the host is available.
          These two queries can be valuable when administrators specifically
          block echo request packets while forgetting that other ICMP
          queries can be used for the same purpose.</para>

        <listitem>

          <para>One of the most common Nmap usage scenarios is to scan
          an ethernet LAN. On most LANs, especially those using
          RFC1918-blessed private address ranges, the vast majority of
          IP addresses are unused at any given time.  When Nmap tries
          to send a raw IP packet such as an ICMP echo request, the
          operating system must determine the destination hardware
          (ARP) address corresponding to the target IP so that it can
          properly address the ethernet frame.  This is often slow and
          problematic, since operating systems weren't written with
          the expectation that they would need to do millions of ARP
          requests against unavailable hosts in a short time
          period.</para>

          <para>ARP scan puts Nmap and its optimized algorithms in
          charge of ARP requests.  And if it gets a response back,
          Nmap doesn't even need to worry about the IP-based ping
          packets since it already knows the host is up.  This makes
          ARP scan much faster and more reliable than IP-based scans.
          So it is done by default when scanning ethernet hosts that Nmap
          detects are on a local ethernet network.  Even if different
          ping types (such as <option>-PE</option> or
          <option>-PS</option>) are specified, Nmap uses ARP instead
          for any of the targets which are on the same LAN.  If you
          absolutely don't want to do an ARP scan, specify
          <option>--send-ip</option>.</para>

 <listitem>

<para>
Traceroutes are performed post-scan using information from the scan results to determine the port and protocol most likely to reach the target. It works with all scan types except connect scans (-sT) and idle scans (-sI).  All traces use Nmap's dynamic timing model and are performed in parallel.
</para>

<para>
Traceroute works by sending packets with a low TTL (time-to-live) in an attempt to illicit ICMP TTL_EXCCEDED messages from intermediate hops between the scanner and the target host. Standard traceroute implementation start with a TTL of 1 and increment the TTL until the destination host is reached. Nmap's traceroute starts with a high TTL and then decrements the TTL until it reaches 0. Doing it backwards lets nmap employ clever caching algorithms to speed up traces over multiple hosts. On average nmap sends 5-10 fewer packets per host, depending on network conditions. If a single subnet is being scanned (i.e. 192.168.0.0/24) nmap may only have to send a single packet to most hosts.

    <title>Port Scanning Basics</title>

          <para>While Nmap has grown in functionality over the years,
          it began as an efficient port scanner, and that remains its
          core function.  The simple command <command>nmap
          <replaceable>target</replaceable></command> scans more than
          1660 TCP ports on the host
          <replaceable>target</replaceable>.  While many port scanners
          have traditionally lumped all ports into the open or closed
          states, Nmap is much more granular.  It divides ports into
          six states: <literal>open</literal>,
          <literal>closed</literal>, <literal>filtered</literal>,
          <literal>unfiltered</literal>,
          <literal>open|filtered</literal>, or
          <literal>closed|filtered</literal>.</para>

<para>These states are not intrinsic
properties of the port itself, but describe how Nmap sees them.  For
example, an Nmap scan from the same network as the target may show
port 135/tcp as open, while a scan at the same time with the same
options from across the Internet might show that port as <literal>filtered</literal>.</para>

  <listitem><para>An application is actively accepting TCP
  connections or UDP packets on this port.  Finding these is often the
  primary goal of port scanning.  Security-minded people know that
  each open port is an avenue for attack.  Attackers and pen-testers
  want to exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or
  protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate users.
  Open ports are also interesting for non-security scans because they show
  services available for use on the network.

  of OS detection.  Because closed ports are reachable, it may be
  worth scanning later in case some open up.  Administrators may want
  to consider blocking such ports with a firewall.  Then they would
  appear in the filtered state, discussed next.

  <listitem><para>Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open
  because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port.

  rules, or host-based firewall software.  These ports frustrate
  attackers because they provide so little information.  Sometimes
  they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13
  (destination unreachable: communication administratively
  prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding
  are far more common.  This forces Nmap to retry several times just
  in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than
  filtering.  This slows down the scan dramatically.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term>unfiltered</term>
  <listitem><para>The unfiltered state means that a port is accessible,

  the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets, classifies
  ports into this state.  Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan
  types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve
  whether the port is open.

  <title>Port Scanning Techniques</title>

<para>As a novice performing automotive repair, I can struggle
for hours trying to fit my rudimentary tools (hammer, duct tape,
wrench, etc.)  to the task at hand.  When I fail miserably and tow my
jalopy to a real mechanic, he invariably fishes around in a huge tool chest until
pulling out the perfect gizmo which makes the job seem effortless.  The
art of port scanning is similar.  Experts understand the dozens of
scan techniques and choose the appropriate one (or combination) for a
given task.  Inexperienced users and script kiddies, on the other
hand, try to solve every problem with the default SYN scan.  Since Nmap is
free, the only barrier to port scanning mastery is knowledge.  That
certainly beats the automotive world, where it may take great skill to
determine that you need a strut spring compressor, then you still
have to pay thousands of dollars for it.</para>

<para>Most of the scan types are only available to privileged users.
This is because they send and receive raw packets, which requires root
access on Unix systems.  Using an administrator account on Windows is
recommended, though Nmap sometimes works for unprivileged users on that
platform when WinPcap has already been loaded into the OS.  Requiring
root privileges was a serious limitation when Nmap was released in
1997, as many users only had access to shared shell accounts.  Now,
the world is different.  Computers are cheaper, far more people have
always-on direct Internet access, and desktop Unix systems (including
Linux and Mac OS X) are prevalent.  A Windows version of Nmap is now
available, allowing it to run on even more desktops.  For all these
reasons, users have less need to run Nmap from limited shared shell accounts.
This is fortunate, as the privileged options make Nmap far more
powerful and flexible.</para>

<para>While Nmap attempts to produce accurate results, keep in mind
that all of its insights are based on packets returned by the target
machines (or firewalls in front of them).  Such hosts may be
untrustworthy and send responses intended to confuse or mislead Nmap.
Much more common are non-RFC-compliant hosts that do not respond as
they should to Nmap probes.  FIN, null, and Xmas scans are
particularly susceptible to this problem.  Such issues are specific to
certain scan types and so are
discussed in the individual scan type entries.</para>

<para>This section documents the dozen or so port scan
techniques supported by Nmap.  Only one method may be used at a time,
except that UDP scan (<option>-sU</option>) may be combined with any
one of the TCP scan types.  As a memory aid, port scan type options
are of the form <option>-s<replaceable>C</replaceable></option>, where
<replaceable>C</replaceable> is a prominent character in the scan
name, usually the first.  The one exception to this is the deprecated
FTP bounce scan (<option>-b</option>).  By default, Nmap performs a
SYN Scan, though it substitutes a connect scan if the user does not
have proper privileges to send raw packets (requires root access on
Unix) or if IPv6 targets were specified.  Of the scans listed in this
section, unprivileged users can only execute connect and FTP bounce
scans.</para>

<para>SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good
reasons.  It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per
second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls. SYN scan
is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy, since it never completes TCP
connections.  It also works against any compliant TCP stack rather
than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's
FIN/null/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do.  It also allows clear,
reliable differentiation between the <literal>open</literal>,
<literal>closed</literal>, and <literal>filtered</literal>
states.</para>

<para>This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning,
because you don't open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet,
as if you are going to open a real connection and then wait for a
response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is listening (open), while a
RST (reset) is indicative of a non-listener. If no response is
received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as
filtered.  The port is also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable
error (type 3, code 1,2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.</para>

<para>TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is
not an option.  This is the case when a user does not have raw packet
privileges or is scanning IPv6 networks.  Instead of writing raw
packets as most other scan types do, Nmap asks the underlying
operating system to establish a connection with the target machine and
port by issuing the <literal>connect()</literal> system call.  This is
the same high-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and
most other network-enabled applications use to establish a connection.
It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets
API.  Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, Nmap uses
this API to obtain status information on each connection attempt.
</para>

<para>When SYN scan is available, it is usually a better choice.  Nmap
has less control over the high level <literal>connect()</literal> call
than with raw packets, making it less efficient.  The system call
completes connections to open target ports rather than performing the
half-open reset that SYN scan does.  Not only does this take longer
and require more packets to obtain the same information, but target
machines are more likely to log the connection.  A decent IDS will
catch either, but most machines have no such alarm system.  Many
services on your average Unix system will add a note to syslog, and
sometimes a cryptic error message, when Nmap connects and then closes
the connection without sending data.  Truly pathetic services crash
when this happens, though that is uncommon.  An administrator who sees
a bunch of connection attempts in her logs from a single system should
know that she has been connect scanned.</para>

</term>
        <listitem>

<para>While most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP
protocol, <ulink
url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc768.txt">UDP</ulink> services
are widely deployed.  DNS, SNMP, and DHCP
(registered ports 53, 161/162, and 67/68) are three of the most
common.  Because UDP scanning is generally slower and more difficult
than TCP, some security auditors ignore these ports.  This is a mistake, as
exploitable UDP services are quite common and attackers certainly
don't ignore the whole protocol.  Fortunately, Nmap can help inventory
UDP ports.</para>

<para>UDP scan is activated with the <option>-sU</option> option.  It
can be combined with a TCP scan type such as SYN scan
(<option>-sS</option>) to check both protocols during the same
run.</para>

<para>UDP scan works by sending an empty (no data) UDP header to every
targeted port.  If an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is
returned, the port is <literal>closed</literal>.  Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3,
codes 1, 2, 9, 10, or 13) mark the port as <literal>filtered</literal>.  Occasionally, a
service will respond with a UDP packet, proving that it is <literal>open</literal>.  If
no response is received after retransmissions, the port is classified
as <literal>open|filtered</literal>.  This means that the port could be open, or perhaps
packet filters are blocking the communication. Versions scan
(<option>-sV</option>) can be used to help differentiate the truly
open ports from the filtered ones.</para>

<para>A big challenge with UDP scanning is doing it quickly.
Open and filtered ports rarely send any response, leaving Nmap to time
out and then conduct retransmissions just in case the probe or
response were lost.  Closed ports are often an even bigger problem.
They usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error.  But unlike the
RST packets sent by closed TCP ports in response to a SYN or connect
scan, many hosts rate limit ICMP port unreachable messages by default.
Linux and Solaris are particularly strict about this.  For example, the
Linux 2.4.20 kernel limits destination unreachable messages to one per
second (in <filename>net/ipv4/icmp.c</filename>).</para>

<para>Nmap detects rate limiting and slows down accordingly to avoid
flooding the network with useless packets that the target machine will
drop.  Unfortunately, a Linux-style limit of one packet per second
makes a 65,536-port scan take more than 18 hours.  Ideas for speeding
your UDP scans up include scanning more hosts in parallel, doing a
quick scan of just the popular ports first, scanning from behind the
firewall, and using <option>--host-timeout</option> to skip slow
hosts.</para>

<para>These three scan types (even more are possible with the
<option>--scanflags</option> option described in the next section)
exploit a subtle loophole in the <ulink
url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">TCP RFC</ulink> to
differentiate between <literal>open</literal> and
<literal>closed</literal> ports.  Page 65 says that <quote>if the
[destination] port state is CLOSED .... an incoming segment not
containing a RST causes a RST to be sent in response.</quote>  Then the next
page discusses packets sent to open ports without the SYN, RST, or ACK
bits set, stating that: <quote>you are unlikely to get here, but if you do, drop the
segment, and return.</quote></para>

<para>When scanning systems compliant with this RFC text, any packet
not containing SYN, RST, or ACK bits will result in a returned RST if
the port is closed and no response at all if the port is open.  As
long as none of those three bits are included, any combination of the
other three (FIN, PSH, and URG) are OK.  Nmap exploits this with three
scan types:</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term>Null scan (<option>-sN</option>)</term>
  <listitem><para>Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)</para></listitem></varlistentry>

  <listitem><para>Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the
  packet up like a Christmas tree.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These three scan types are exactly the same in behavior except
for the TCP flags set in probe packets.  If a RST packet is received,
the port is considered <literal>closed</literal>, while no response
means it is <literal>open|filtered</literal>.  The port is marked
<literal>filtered</literal> if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code
1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.</para>

<para>The key advantage to these scan types is that they can sneak
through certain non-stateful firewalls and packet filtering
routers. Another advantage is that these scan types are a little more
stealthy than even a SYN scan.  Don't count on this though&mdash;most
modern IDS products can be configured to detect them.  The big
downside is that not all systems follow RFC 793 to the letter.  A
number of systems send RST responses to the probes regardless of
whether the port is open or not.  This causes all of the ports to be
labeled <literal>closed</literal>.  Major operating systems that do
this are Microsoft Windows, many Cisco devices, BSDI, and IBM OS/400.
This scan does work against most Unix-based systems though. Another
downside of these scans is that they can't distinguish <literal>open</literal> ports from
certain <literal>filtered</literal> ones, leaving you with the response
<literal>open|filtered</literal>.</para>

<para>This scan is different than the others discussed so far in that

<para>The ACK scan probe packet has only the ACK flag set (unless you

<literal>open</literal> and <literal>closed</literal> ports will both
return a RST packet.  Nmap then labels them as
<literal>unfiltered</literal>, meaning that they are reachable by the
ACK packet, but whether they are <literal>open</literal> or
<literal>closed</literal> is undetermined.  Ports that don't respond,
or send certain ICMP error messages back (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10,

<para>Window scan is exactly the same as ACK scan except that it
exploits an implementation detail of certain systems to differentiate
open ports from closed ones, rather than always printing
<literal>unfiltered</literal> when a RST is returned.  It does this by
examining the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned.  On some
systems, open ports use a positive window size (even for RST packets)
while closed ones have a zero window.  So instead of always listing a
port as <literal>unfiltered</literal> when it receives a RST back,
Window scan lists the port as <literal>open</literal> or
<literal>closed</literal> if the TCP Window value in that reset is
positive or zero, respectively.</para>

<para>This scan relies on an implementation detail of a minority of
systems out on the Internet, so you can't always trust it.  Systems
that don't support it will usually return all ports
<literal>closed</literal>.  Of course, it is possible that the machine
really has no open ports.  If most scanned ports are
<literal>closed</literal> but a few common port numbers (such as 22,
25, 53) are <literal>filtered</literal>, the system is most likely
susceptible.  Occasionally, systems will even show the exact opposite
behavior.  If your scan shows 1000 open ports and 3 closed or filtered
ports, then those three may very well be the truly open ones.</para>

Nmap, which included this technique, was released two issues later.
This technique is exactly the same as null, FIN, and Xmas scans, except
that the probe is FIN/ACK.  According to RFC 793 (TCP), a RST packet
should be generated in response to such a probe whether the port is
open or closed.  However, Uriel noticed that many BSD-derived systems
simply drop the packet if the port is open.</para>

<para>Truly advanced Nmap users need not limit themselves to the
canned scan types offered.  The <option>--scanflags</option> option allows
you to design your own scan by specifying arbitrary TCP flags.  Let
your creative juices flow, while evading intrusion detection systems whose vendors simply paged through the Nmap man page adding specific rules!</para>

<para>The <option>--scanflags</option> argument can be a numerical
flag value such as 9 (PSH and FIN), but using symbolic names is
easier.  Just mash together any combination of  <literal>URG</literal>,
<literal>ACK</literal>, <literal>PSH</literal>,
<literal>RST</literal>, <literal>SYN</literal>, and
<literal>FIN</literal>.  For example, <option>--scanflags
URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN</option> sets everything, though it's not very
useful for scanning.  The order these are specified in is
irrelevant.</para>

<para>In addition to specifying the desired flags, you can specify a
TCP scan type (such as <option>-sA</option> or <option>-sF</option>).
That base type tells Nmap how to interpret responses.  For
example, a SYN scan considers no-response to indicate a
<literal>filtered</literal> port, while a FIN scan treats the same as
<literal>open|filtered</literal>.  Nmap will behave the same way it
does for the base scan type, except that it will use the TCP flags you
specify instead.  If you don't specify a base type, SYN scan is
used.</para>

          <para>This advanced scan method allows for a truly blind TCP
          port scan of the target (meaning no packets are sent to the
          target from your real IP address). Instead, a unique
          side-channel attack exploits predictable IP fragmentation ID
          sequence generation on the zombie host to glean information
          about the open ports on the target.  IDS systems will
          display the scan as coming from the zombie machine you
          specify (which must be up and meet certain criteria). This
          fascinating scan type is too complex to fully describe in this reference

          <para>Besides being extraordinarily stealthy (due to its
          blind nature), this scan type permits mapping out

          <emphasis>from the perspective of the zombie

<para>IP protocol scan allows you to determine which IP protocols
(TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines.  This isn't
technically a port scan, since it cycles through IP protocol numbers
rather than TCP or UDP port numbers. Yet it still uses the
<option>-p</option> option to select scanned protocol numbers, reports
its results within the normal port table format, and even uses the same
underlying scan engine as the true port scanning methods. So it is
close enough to a port scan that it belongs here.</para>

<para>Besides being useful in its own right, protocol scan
demonstrates the power of open source software.  While the fundamental
idea is pretty simple, I had not thought to add it nor received any
requests for such functionality.  Then in the summer of 2000, Gerhard
Rieger conceived the idea, wrote an excellent patch implementing it,
and sent it to the nmap-hackers mailing list.  I incorporated that
patch into the Nmap tree and released a new version the next day.  Few
pieces of commercial software have users enthusiastic enough to design
and contribute their own improvements!</para>

<para>Protocol scan works in a similar fashion to UDP scan.  Instead
of iterating through the port number field of a UDP packet, it sends
IP packet headers and iterates through the 8-bit IP protocol field.
The headers are usually empty, containing no data and not even the
proper header for the claimed protocol.  The three exceptions are TCP,
UDP, and ICMP.  A proper protocol header for those is included since
some systems won't send them otherwise and because Nmap already has
functions to create them.  Instead of watching for ICMP port
unreachable messages, protocol scan is on the lookout for ICMP
<emphasis>protocol</emphasis> unreachable messages.  If Nmap receives
any response in any protocol from the target host, Nmap marks that
protocol as <literal>open</literal>.  An ICMP protocol unreachable
error (type 3, code 2) causes the protocol to be marked as
<literal>closed</literal> Other ICMP unreachable errors (type 3, code
1, 3, 9, 10, or 13) cause the protocol to be marked
<literal>filtered</literal> (though they prove that ICMP is
<literal>open</literal> at the same time).  If no response is received
after retransmissions, the protocol is marked
<literal>open|filtered</literal></para>

<para>An interesting feature of the FTP protocol (<ulink
url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc959.txt">RFC 959</ulink>) is
support for so-called proxy FTP connections.  This allows a user to
connect to one FTP server, then ask that files be sent to a
third-party server.  Such a feature is ripe for abuse on many levels,
so most servers have ceased supporting it.  One of the abuses this
feature allows is causing the FTP server to port scan other hosts.
Simply ask the FTP server to send a file to each interesting port of a
target host in turn.  The error message will describe whether the port
is open or not.  This is a good way to bypass firewalls because
organizational FTP servers are often placed where they have
more access to other internal hosts than any old Internet host would.  Nmap supports FTP
bounce scan with the <option>-b</option> option.  It takes an argument
of the form
<replaceable>username</replaceable>:<replaceable>password</replaceable>@<replaceable>server</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable>.
<replaceable>Server</replaceable> is the name or IP address of a
vulnerable FTP server.  As with a normal URL, you may omit
<replaceable>username</replaceable>:<replaceable>password</replaceable>,
in which case anonymous login credentials (user:
<literal>anonymous</literal> password:<literal>-wwwuser@</literal>)
are used.  The port number (and preceding colon) may be omitted as
well, in which case the default FTP port (21) on
<replaceable>server</replaceable> is used.</para>

<para>This vulnerability was widespread in 1997 when Nmap was
released, but has largely been fixed.  Vulnerable servers are still
around, so it is worth trying when all else fails.  If bypassing a
firewall is your goal, scan the target network for open port 21 (or
even for any FTP services if you scan all ports with version
detection), then try a bounce scan using each.  Nmap will tell you
whether the host is vulnerable or not.  If you are just trying to
cover your tracks, you don't need to (and, in fact, shouldn't) limit
yourself to hosts on the target network.  Before you go scanning
random Internet addresses for vulnerable FTP servers, consider that
sysadmins may not appreciate you abusing their servers in this
way.</para>

    <para>Point Nmap at a remote machine and it might tell you
    that ports 25/tcp, 80/tcp, and 53/udp are open. Using its
    <filename>nmap-services</filename> database of about 2,200 well-known services,
    Nmap would report that those ports probably correspond to a
    mail server (SMTP), web server (HTTP), and name server (DNS)
    respectively. This lookup is usually accurate&mdash;the vast
    majority of daemons listening on TCP port 25 are, in fact, mail
    servers. However, you should not bet your security on this!
    People can and do run services on strange ports.</para>

    <para>Even if Nmap is right, and the hypothetical server above is
    running SMTP, HTTP, and DNS servers, that is not a lot of
    information. When doing vulnerability assessments (or even simple
    network inventories) of your companies or clients, you really want
    to know which mail and DNS servers and versions are
    running. Having an accurate version number helps dramatically in
    determining which exploits a server is vulnerable to.  Version
    detection helps you obtain this information.
</para>

    <para>After TCP and/or UDP ports are discovered using one of the
    other scan methods, version detection interrogates those ports to
    determine more about what is actually running. The
    <filename>nmap-service-probes</filename> database contains probes
    for querying various services and match expressions to recognize
    and parse responses. Nmap tries to determine the service protocol
    (e.g. FTP, SSH, telnet, http), the application name (e.g. ISC
    BIND, Apache httpd, Solaris telnetd), the version number,
    hostname, device type (e.g. printer, router), the OS family
    (e.g. Windows, Linux) and sometimes miscellaneous details like
    whether an X server is open to connections, the SSH protocol
    version, or the KaZaA user name).  Of course, most services don't
    provide all of this information.  If Nmap was compiled with
    OpenSSL support, it will connect to SSL servers to deduce the
    service listening behind that encryption layer. When RPC services are
    discovered, the Nmap RPC grinder (<option>-sR</option>) is
    automatically used to determine the RPC program and version
    numbers. Some UDP ports are left in the
    <literal>open|filtered</literal> state after a UDP port scan is
    unable to determine whether the port is open or filtered. Version
    detection will try to elicit a response from these ports (just as
    it does with open ports), and change the state to open if it
    succeeds. <literal>open|filtered</literal> TCP ports are treated
    the same way.  Note that the Nmap <option>-A</option> option
    enables version detection among other things.  A paper documenting
    the workings, usage, and customization of version detection is
    available at <ulink
    url="http://insecure.org/nmap/vscan/" />.</para>

    <para>When Nmap receives responses from a service but cannot match
    them to its database, it prints out a special fingerprint and
    a URL for you to submit if to if you know for sure what is running
    on the port.  Please take a couple minutes to make the submission
    so that your find can benefit everyone.  Thanks to these
    submissions, Nmap has about 3,000 pattern matches for more than
    350 protocols such as SMTP, FTP, HTTP, etc.</para>

          against a wide variety of common services, while the higher
          numbered ones are rarely useful. The intensity level
          specifies which probes should be applied. The higher the
          number, the more likely it is the service will be correctly
          identified. However, high intensity scans take longer.  The
          intensity must be between 0 and 9. The default is 7.  When a
          probe is registered to the target port via the
          <filename>nmap-service-probes</filename> <literal>ports</literal> directive, that probe is tried
          regardless of intensity level.  This ensures that the DNS

    <title>OS Detection<indexterm><primary>OS detection</primary></indexterm></title>

    <para>One of Nmap's best-known features is remote OS detection
    using TCP/IP stack fingerprinting.  Nmap sends a series of TCP and
    UDP packets to the remote host and examines practically every bit
    in the responses.  After performing dozens of tests such as TCP
    ISN sampling, TCP options support and ordering, IP ID sampling, and
    the initial window size check, Nmap compares the results to its
    <filename>nmap-os-fingerprints</filename> database of more than 1500 known
    OS fingerprints and prints out the OS details if there is a match.
    Each fingerprint includes a freeform textual description of the
    OS, and a classification which provides the vendor name
    (e.g. Sun), underlying OS (e.g. Solaris), OS generation (e.g. 10),
    and device type (general purpose, router, switch, game console,
    etc).</para>

    <para>If Nmap is unable to guess the OS of a machine, and
    conditions are good (e.g. at least one open port and one closed
    port were found), Nmap will
    provide a URL you can use to submit the fingerprint if you know
    (for sure) the OS running on the machine.  By doing this you
    contribute to the pool of operating systems known to Nmap and thus
    it will be more accurate for everyone.</para>

    <para>OS detection enables several other tests which make use
    of information that is gathered during the process anyway.  One of these
    is uptime measurement, which uses the TCP timestamp option (RFC
    1323) to guess when a machine was last rebooted.  This is only
    reported for machines which provide this information.  Another is
    TCP Sequence Predictability Classification.  This measures
    approximately how hard it is to establish a forged
    TCP connection against the remote host.  It is useful for
    exploiting source-IP based trust relationships (rlogin, firewall
    filters, etc) or for hiding the source of an attack.  This sort of
    spoofing is rarely performed any more, but many machines are still
    vulnerable to it.  The actual
    difficulty number is based on statistical sampling and may
    fluctuate.  It is generally better to use the English
    classification such as <quote>worthy challenge</quote> or <quote>trivial joke</quote>.  This
    is only reported in normal output in verbose (<option>-v</option>)
    mode.  When verbose mode is enabled along with <option>-O</option>, IP ID sequence
    generation is also reported.  Most machines are in the
    <quote>incremental</quote> class, which means that they increment the ID
    field in the IP header for each packet they send.  This makes them
    vulnerable to several advanced information gathering and
    spoofing attacks.</para>

          you are certain about what the target host is running), or
          Nmap will fall back to the 1st generation OS detection

          Nmap up, though you miss out on retries which could

    complex probes. The Skype-Protocol version 2 for instance can be identified
    by sending 2 independent probes to it, which the builtin system is not laid
    out for: a simple NSE-script can do the job and update the port's service

    can help to identify those loopholes easily.  
    </para> 
    <para> 
    <emphasis>Vulnerability Detection</emphasis> (category

    <para>
    <emphasis>Network Discovery and Information Gathering</emphasis>
    (categories <literal>safe</literal>, <literal>intrusive</literal> and
    <literal>discovery</literal>)&mdash;By providing you with a scripting language
    and a really efficient asynchronous network API on the one hand and the
    information gathered during earlier stages of a scan on the other hand the
    NSE is suited to write client programs for the services listening on a
    target machine. These clients may collect information like: listings of
    available NFS/SMB/RPC shares, the number of channels of an irc-network or
    currently logged on users. 
    </para>
    
    <para> 
    To reflect those different uses and to simplify the choice of which
    scripts to run, each script contains a field associating it with one or more
    of the above mentioned categories. To maintain the matching from scripts to
    categories a file called <filename>script.db</filename> is installed along
    with the distributed scripts. Therefore, if you, for example, want to see if
    a machine is infected by any worm Nmap provides a script for you can simply
    run <command>nmap --script=malware target-ip</command> and check the output
    afterwards. The <literal>version</literal> scripts are always run
    implicitely when a script-scan is requested. The
    <filename>script.db</filename> is a Lua-script itself and can be updated
    through the <option>--script-updatedb</option> option.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
    A NSE-script basically is a chunk of Lua-code which has (among some
    informational fields, like name, id and categories) 2 functions: a test
    whether the particular script should be run against a certain host or port
    (called a <literal>hostrule</literal> or <literal>portrule</literal>
    respectively) and an <literal>action</literal> to be carried out if the test
    returns true. Scripts have access to most information gathered by Nmap
    during earlier stages. For each host this includes the IP address,  hostname and (if
    available) operating system. If a script is targeted at a port it has access
    to the portnumber, the protocol (<literal>tcp</literal>, <literal>udp</literal> or <literal>ssl</literal>), the service running
    behind that port, and optionally information from a version-scan.
    NSE-scripts have by convention a <literal>.nse</literal>-extension. Although
    you are not required to follow this for the moment, this may change in the
    future. Nmap will issue a warning if a file has any other extension.

    <title>Timing and Performance</title>
    <para>One of my highest Nmap development priorities has always been
performance.  A default scan (<command>nmap
<replaceable>hostname</replaceable></command>) of a host on my local
network takes a fifth of a second.  That is barely enough time to
blink, but adds up when you are scanning tens or hundreds of thousands
of hosts.  Moreover, certain scan options such as UDP scanning and
version detection can increase scan times substantially.  So can
certain firewall configurations, particularly response rate limiting.
While Nmap utilizes parallelism and many advanced algorithms to
accelerate these scans, the user has ultimate control over how Nmap
runs.  Expert users carefully craft Nmap commands to obtain only the
information they care about while meeting their time
constraints.</para>

    <para>Techniques for improving scan times include omitting
    non-critical tests, and upgrading to the latest version of Nmap
    (performance enhancements are made frequently).  Optimizing timing
    parameters can also make a substantial difference.  Those options
    are listed below.</para>

<para>Some options accept a <literal>time</literal> parameter.  This
is specified in milliseconds by default, though you can append &lsquo;s&rsquo;, &lsquo;m&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;h&rsquo; to the value to specify seconds, minutes, or hours. So the
<option>--host-timeout</option> arguments <literal>900000</literal>,
<literal>900s</literal>, and <literal>15m</literal> all do the same thing.</para>

<para>Nmap has the ability to port scan or version scan multiple hosts
in parallel.  Nmap does this by dividing the target IP space into
groups and then scanning one group at a time.  In general, larger
groups are more efficient.  The downside is that host results can't be
provided until the whole group is finished.  So if Nmap started out
with a group size of 50, the user would not receive any reports
(except for the updates offered in verbose mode) until the first 50
hosts are completed.</para>

<para>By default, Nmap takes a compromise approach to this conflict.
It starts out with a group size as low as five so the first results
come quickly and then increases the groupsize to as high as 1024.  The
exact default numbers depend on the options given.  For efficiency
reasons, Nmap uses larger group sizes for UDP or few-port TCP
scans.</para>

<para>When a maximum group size is specified with
<option>--max-hostgroup</option>, Nmap will never exceed that size.
Specify a minimum size with <option>--min-hostgroup</option> and Nmap
will try to keep group sizes above that level.  Nmap may have to use
smaller groups than you specify if there are not enough target hosts
left on a given interface to fulfill the specified minimum.  Both may
be set to keep the group size within a specific range, though this is
rarely desired.</para>

<para>These options do not have an effect during the host discovery
phase of a scan. This includes plain ping scans (<option>-sP</option>).
Host discovery always works in large groups of hosts to improve speed
and accuracy.</para>

<para>The primary use of these options is to specify a large minimum
group size so that the full scan runs more quickly.  A common choice
is 256 to scan a network in Class C sized chunks.  For a scan with
many ports, exceeding that number is unlikely to help much. For scans
of just a few port numbers, host group sizes of 2048 or more may be
helpful.</para>

<para>These options control the total number of probes that may
be outstanding for a host group.  They are used for port scanning and
host discovery.  By default, Nmap calculates an ever-changing ideal
parallelism based on network performance.  If packets are being dropped,
Nmap slows down and allows fewer outstanding probes.  The ideal probe
number slowly rises as the network proves itself worthy.  These
options place minimum or maximum bounds on that variable.  By default,
the ideal parallelism can drop to 1 if the network proves unreliable
and rise to several hundred in perfect conditions.</para>

<para>The most common usage is to set
<option>--min-parallelism</option> to a number higher than one to
speed up scans of poorly performing hosts or networks.  This is a
risky option to play with, as setting it too high may affect accuracy.
Setting this also reduces Nmap's ability to control parallelism
dynamically based on network conditions.  A value of ten might be
reasonable, though I only adjust this value as a last resort.</para>

<para>The <option>--max-parallelism</option> option is sometimes set to one
to prevent Nmap from sending more than one probe at a time to hosts.
This can be useful in combination with <option>--scan-delay</option>
(discussed later), although the latter usually serves the purpose well
enough by itself.</para>

<para>Nmap maintains a
running timeout value for determining how long it will wait for a
probe response before giving up or retransmitting the probe.  This is
calculated based on the response times of previous probes.  If
the network latency shows itself to be significant and variable, this
timeout can grow to several seconds.  It also starts at a conservative
(high) level and may stay that way for a while when Nmap scans
unresponsive hosts.</para>

<para>
Specifying a lower <option>--max-rtt-timeout</option> and
<option>--initial-rtt-timeout</option> than the defaults can cut scan
times significantly.  This is particularly true for pingless
(<option>-P0</option>) scans, and those against heavily filtered
networks.  Don't get too aggressive though.  The scan can end up
taking longer if you specify such a low value that many probes are
timing out and retransmitting while the response is in transit.</para>

<para>If all the hosts are on a local network, 100 milliseconds is a
reasonable aggressive <option>--max-rtt-timeout</option> value.  If
routing is involved, ping a host on the network first with the ICMP
ping utility, or with a custom packet crafter such as hping2 that is
more likely to get through a firewall.  Look at the maximum round trip
time out of ten packets or so.  You might want to double that for the
<option>--initial-rtt-timeout</option> and triple or quadruple it for
the <option>--max-rtt-timeout</option>.  I generally do not set the
maximum RTT below 100ms, no matter what the ping times are.  Nor do I
exceed 1000ms.</para>

<para><option>--min-rtt-timeout</option> is a rarely used option that
could be useful when a network is so unreliable that even Nmap's
default is too aggressive.  Since Nmap only reduces the timeout down to
the minimum when the network seems to be reliable, this need is
unusual and should be reported as a bug to the nmap-dev mailing
list.</para>

        <listitem>


<para>When Nmap receives no response to a port scan probe, it could
mean the port is filtered.  Or maybe the probe or response was simply
lost on the network.  It is also possible that the target host has
rate limiting enabled that temporarily blocked the response.  So Nmap
tries again by retransmitting the initial probe.  If Nmap detects poor
network reliability, it may try many more times before giving up on a
port.  While this benefits accuracy, it also lengthen scan times.
When performance is critical, scans may be sped up by limiting the
number of retransmissions allowed.  You can even specify
<option>--max-retries 0</option> to prevent any retransmissions,
though that is rarely recommended.
</para>

<para>The default (with no <option>-T</option> template) is to allow
ten retransmissions.  If a network seems reliable and the target hosts
aren't rate limiting, Nmap usually only does one retransmission.  So
most target scans aren't even affected by dropping
<option>--max-retries</option> to a low value such as three.  Such
values can substantially speed scans of slow (rate limited) hosts.
You usually lose some information when Nmap gives up on ports early,
though that may be preferable to letting the
<option>--host-timeout</option> expire and losing all information
about the target.</para>

often specify <literal>30m</literal> to ensure that Nmap doesn't waste
more than half an hour on a single host.  Note that Nmap may be
scanning other hosts at the same time during that half an hour as
well, so it isn't a complete loss.  A host that times out is skipped.
No port table, OS detection, or version detection results are printed

<para>This option causes Nmap to wait at least the given amount of
time between each probe it sends to a given host.  This is
particularly useful in the case of rate limiting.  Solaris machines
(among many others) will usually respond to UDP scan probe packets
with only one ICMP message per second.  Any more than that sent by
Nmap will be wasteful.  A <option>--scan-delay</option> of
<literal>1s</literal> will keep Nmap at that slow rate.  Nmap tries to
detect rate limiting and adjust the scan delay accordingly, but it
doesn't hurt to specify it explicitly if you already know what rate
works best.</para>

<para>When Nmap adjusts the scan delay upward to cope with rate
limiting, the scan slows down dramatically.  The
<option>--max-scan-delay</option> option specifies the largest delay
that Nmap will allow.  Setting this value too low can lead to wasteful
packet retransmissions and possible missed ports when the target
implements strict rate limiting.</para>

<para>Many hosts have long used rate limiting to reduce the number
of ICMP error messages (such as port-unreachable errors) they send.
Some systems now apply similar rate limits to the RST (reset)
packets they generate.  This can slow Nmap down dramatically as it
adjusts its timing to reflect those rate limits.  You can tell Nmap to
ignore those rate limits (for port scans such as SYN scan which
<emphasis>don't</emphasis> treat nonresponsive ports as
<literal>open</literal>) by specifying
<option>--defeat-rst-ratelimit</option>.</para>

<para>Using this option can reduce accuracy, as some ports will appear
nonresponse because Nmap didn't wait long enough for a rate-limited
RST response.  With a SYN
scan, the non-response results in the port being labeled
<literal>filtered</literal> rather than the <literal>closed</literal>
state we see when RST packets are received.  This optional is useful
when you only care about open ports, and distinguishing between
<literal>closed</literal> and <literal>filtered</literal> ports isn't

        </term>
        <listitem>


<para>While the fine-grained timing controls discussed in the previous
section are powerful and effective, some people find them confusing.
Moreover, choosing the appropriate values can sometimes take more time
than the scan you are trying to optimize.  So Nmap offers a simpler
approach, with six timing templates.  You can specify them with the
<option>-T</option> option and their number (0&ndash;5) or their name.
The template names are <option>paranoid</option> (<option>0</option>),
<option>sneaky</option> (<option>1</option>), <option>polite</option>
(<option>2</option>), <option>normal</option> (<option>3</option>),
<option>aggressive</option> (<option>4</option>), and
<option>insane</option> (<option>5</option>).  The first two are for
IDS evasion.  Polite mode slows down the scan to use less bandwidth
and target machine resources.  Normal mode is the default and so
<option>-T3</option> does nothing. Aggressive mode speeds scans up by
making the assumption that you are on a reasonably fast and reliable
network.  Finally insane mode assumes that you are on an
extraordinarily fast network or are willing to sacrifice some accuracy
for speed.</para>

<para>These templates allow the user to specify how aggressive they
wish to be, while leaving Nmap to pick the exact timing values.  The
templates also make some minor speed adjustments for which
fine-grained control options do not currently exist.  For example,
<option>-T4</option> prohibits the dynamic scan delay from exceeding
10ms for TCP ports and <option>-T5</option> caps that value at 5
milliseconds.  Templates can be used in combination with fine-grained
controls, and the fine-grained controls will you specify will take
precedence over the timing template default for that parameter.  I
recommend using <option>-T4</option> when scanning reasonably modern
and reliable networks.  Keep that option even when you add
fine-grained controls so that you benefit from those extra minor
optimizations that it enables.</para>

<para>If you are on a decent broadband or ethernet connection, I would
recommend always using <option>-T4</option>.  Some people love
<option>-T5</option> though it is too aggressive for my taste.  People
sometimes specify <option>-T2</option> because they think it is less
likely to crash hosts or because they consider themselves to be polite
in general.  They often don't realize just how slow <option>-T
polite</option> really is.  Their scan may take ten times longer than a
default scan.
Machine crashes and bandwidth problems are rare with the
default timing options (<option>-T3</option>) and so I normally
recommend that for cautious scanners.  Omitting version detection is
far more effective than playing with timing values at reducing these
problems.</para>

<para>While <option>-T0</option> and <option>-T1</option> may be
useful for avoiding IDS alerts, they will take an extraordinarily long
time to scan thousands of machines or ports.  For such a long scan,
you may prefer to set the exact timing values you need rather than
rely on the canned <option>-T0</option> and <option>-T1</option>
values.</para>

<para>The main effects of <option>T0</option> are serializing the scan
so only one port is scanned at a time, and waiting five minutes
between sending each probe.  <option>T1</option> and
<option>T2</option> are similar but they only wait 15 seconds and 0.4
seconds, respectively, between probes.  <option>T3</option> is Nmap's
default behavior, which includes parallelization.  <option>T4</option>
does the equivalent of <option>--max-rtt-timeout 1250
--initial-rtt-timeout 500 --max-retries 6</option> and sets the maximum TCP scan delay
to 10 milliseconds.  <option>T5</option> does the equivalent of
<option>--max-rtt-timeout 300 --min-rtt-timeout 50
--initial-rtt-timeout 250 --max-retries 2 --host-timeout 15m</option> as well as
setting the maximum TCP scan delay to 5ms.</para>

    <title>Firewall/IDS Evasion and Spoofing</title>

<para>Many Internet pioneers envisioned a global open network with a
universal IP address space allowing virtual connections between any
two nodes.  This allows hosts to act as true peers, serving and
retrieving information from each other.  People could access all of
their home systems from work, changing the climate control settings or
unlocking the doors for early guests.  This vision of universal
connectivity has been stifled by address space shortages and security
concerns.  In the early 1990s, organizations began deploying
firewalls for the express purpose of reducing connectivity.  Huge
networks were cordoned off from the unfiltered Internet by application
proxies, network address translation, and packet filters.  The
unrestricted flow of information gave way to tight regulation of
approved communication channels and the content that passes over
them.</para>

<para>Network obstructions such as firewalls can make mapping a
network exceedingly difficult.  It will not get any easier, as
stifling casual reconnaissance is often a key goal of implementing the
devices.   Nevertheless, Nmap offers many features to help understand these
complex networks, and to verify that filters are working as intended.
It even supports mechanisms for bypassing poorly implemented
defenses.  One of the best methods of understanding your
network security posture is to try to defeat it.  Place yourself in
the mindset of an attacker, and deploy techniques from this section
against your networks.  Launch an FTP bounce scan, idle scan,
fragmentation attack, or try to tunnel through one of your own
proxies.</para>

<para>In addition to restricting network activity, companies are
increasingly monitoring traffic with intrusion detection systems
(IDS).  All of the major IDSs ship with rules designed to detect Nmap
scans because scans are sometimes a precursor to attacks.  Many of
these products have recently morphed into intrusion
<emphasis>prevention</emphasis> systems (IPS) that actively block
traffic deemed malicious.  Unfortunately for network administrators
and IDS vendors, reliably detecting bad intentions by analyzing packet
data is a tough problem.  Attackers with patience, skill, and the help
of certain Nmap options can usually pass by IDSs undetected.
Meanwhile, administrators must cope with large numbers of false
positive results where innocent activity is misdiagnosed and alerted
on or blocked.</para>

<para>Occasionally people suggest that Nmap should not offer features
for evading firewall rules or sneaking past IDSs.  They argue
that these features are just as likely to be misused by attackers as
used by administrators to enhance security.  The problem with this
logic is that these methods would still be used by attackers, who
would just find other tools or patch the functionality into Nmap.
Meanwhile, administrators would find it that much harder to do their
jobs.  Deploying only modern, patched FTP servers is a far more
powerful defense than trying to prevent the distribution of tools
implementing the FTP bounce attack.

        <listitem>
          <para>The <option>-f</option> option causes the requested scan (including
          ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets. The idea
          is to split up the TCP header over several packets to
          make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection
          systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are
          doing. Be careful with this! Some programs have trouble
          handling these tiny packets. The old-school sniffer named
          Sniffit segmentation faulted immediately upon receiving
          the first fragment. Specify this option once, and Nmap
          splits the packets into 8 bytes or less after the IP
          header. So a 20-byte TCP header would be split into 3
          packets. Two with eight bytes of the TCP header, and one
          with the final four. Of course each fragment also has an
          IP header. Specify <option>-f</option> again to use 16 bytes per fragment
          (reducing the number of fragments). Or you can specify
          your own offset size with the <option>--mtu</option> option. Don't also
          specify <option>-f</option> if you use <option>--mtu</option>. The offset must be a
          multiple of 8. While fragmented packets won't get by
          packet filters and firewalls that queue all IP fragments,
          such as the CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG option in the Linux
          kernel, some networks can't afford the performance hit
          this causes and thus leave it disabled. Others can't enable
          this because fragments may take different routes into their
          networks.  Some source
          systems defragment outgoing packets in the kernel. Linux
          with the iptables connection tracking module is one such
          example. Do a scan while a sniffer such as <application>Wireshark</application>
          is running to ensure that sent packets are
          fragmented.  If your host OS is causing problems, try the <option>--send-eth</option> option to bypass the IP layer and send raw ethernet frames.</para>

          <para>Causes a decoy scan to be performed, which makes it
          appear to the remote host that the host(s) you specify as
          decoys are scanning the target network too. Thus their IDS
          might report 5-10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but
          they won't know which IP was scanning them and which were
          innocent decoys. While this can be defeated through router
          path tracing, response-dropping, and other active
          mechanisms, it is generally an effective technique for
          hiding your IP address.</para>

          <para>Separate each decoy host with commas, and you can
          optionally use <literal>ME</literal> as one of the decoys to
          represent the position for your real IP address. If you put
          <literal>ME</literal> in the 6th position or later, some
          common port scan detectors (such as Solar Designer's
          excellent Scanlogd) are unlikely to show your IP address at
          all. If you don't use <literal>ME</literal>, nmap will put
          you in a random position.  You can also use RND to generate
          a random, non-reserved IP address, or RND:&lt;number&gt; to
          generate &lt;number&gt; addresses.</para> <para>Note that the hosts
          you use as decoys should be up or you might accidentally SYN
          flood your targets. Also it will be pretty easy to determine
          which host is scanning if only one is actually up on the
          network. You might want to use IP addresses instead of names
          (so the decoy networks don't see you in their nameserver
          logs).</para>

          <para>Decoys are used both in the initial ping scan (using
          ICMP, SYN, ACK, or whatever) and during the actual port
          scanning phase. Decoys are also used during remote OS
          detection (<option>-O</option>).  Decoys do not work with
          version detection or TCP connect scan.</para>

          <para>It is worth noting that using too many decoys may
          slow your scan and potentially even make it less
          accurate. Also, some ISPs will filter out your spoofed
          packets, but many do not restrict
          spoofed IP packets at all.</para>

<para>One surprisingly common misconfiguration is to trust traffic
based only on the source port number.  It is easy to understand how
this comes about.  An administrator will set up a shiny new firewall,
only to be flooded with complains from ungrateful users whose
applications stopped working.  In particular, DNS may be broken
because the UDP DNS replies from external servers can no longer enter
the network.  FTP is another common example.  In active FTP transfers,
the remote server tries to establish a connection back to the client
to transfer the requested file.</para>

<para>Secure solutions to these problems exist, often in the form of
application-level proxies or protocol-parsing firewall modules.
Unfortunately there are also easier, insecure solutions.  Noting that
DNS replies come from port 53 and active FTP from port 20, many administrators
have fallen into the trap of simply allowing incoming traffic from
those ports.  They often assume that no attacker would notice and
exploit such firewall holes.  In other cases, administrators consider this a
short-term stop-gap measure until they can implement a more secure
solution.  Then they forget the security upgrade.
</para>

<para>Overworked network administrators are not the only ones to fall
into this trap.  Numerous products have shipped with these insecure
rules.  Even Microsoft has been guilty.  The IPsec filters that
shipped with Windows 2000 and Windows XP contain an implicit rule that
allows all TCP or UDP traffic from port 88 (Kerberos).  In another well-known
case, versions of the Zone Alarm personal firewall up to 2.1.25
allowed any incoming UDP packets with the source port 53 (DNS) or 67
(DHCP).</para>

<para>Nmap offers the <option>-g</option> and
<option>--source-port</option> options (they are equivalent) to exploit these
weaknesses.  Simply provide a port number and Nmap will send packets
from that port where possible.  Nmap must use different port numbers
for certain OS detection tests to work properly, and DNS requests
ignore the <option>--source-port</option> flag because Nmap relies on system
libraries to handle those.  Most TCP scans, including SYN scan,
support the option completely, as does UDP scan.</para>

          most of the packets it sends. OS detection (<option>-O</option>) packets
          are not affected because accuracy there requires probe consistency, but most pinging and portscan packets
          support this. It slows things down a little, but can make a scan slightly less

      <listitem>
      <para>The <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt">IP
      protocol</ulink> offers several options which may be placed in
      packet headers.  Unlike the ubiquitous TCP options, IP options
      are rarely seen due to practicality and security concerns.  In
      fact, many Internet routers block the most dangerous options
      such as source routing.  Yet options can still be useful in some
      cases for determining and manipulating the network route to
      target machines.  For example, you may be able to use the record
      route option to determine a path to a target even when more
      traditional traceroute-style approaches fail.  Or if your
      packets are being dropped by a certain firewall, you may be able
      to specify a different route with the strict or loose source
      routing options.</para>

      <para>The most powerful way to specify IP options is to simply
      pass in values as the argument to
      <option>--ip-options</option>.  Precede each hex number with
      <literal>\x</literal> then the two digits.  You may repeat
      certain characters by following them with an asterisk and then
      the number of times you wish them to repeat.  For example,
      <literal>\x01\x07\x04\x00*36\x01</literal> is a hex string
      containing 36 NUL bytes.</para>

      <para>Nmap also offers a shortcut mechanism for specifying
      options.  Simply pass the letter <literal>R</literal>,
      <literal>T</literal>, or <literal>U</literal> to request
      record-route, record-timestamp, or both options together,
      respectively.  Loose or strict source routing may be specified
      with an <literal>L</literal> or <literal>S</literal> followed by
      a space and then a space-separated list of IP addresses.</para>

      <para>If you wish to see the options in packets sent and
      received, specify <option>--packet-trace</option>.  For more
      information and examples of using IP options with Nmap, see

    <title>Output</title>

    <para>Any security tools is only as useful as the output it
    generates.  Complex tests and algorithms are of little value if
    they aren't presented in an organized and comprehensible fashion.
    Given the number of ways Nmap is used by people and other
    software, no single format can please everyone.  So Nmap offers
    several formats, including the interactive mode for humans to read
    directly and XML for easy parsing by software.</para>

<para>In addition to offering different output formats, Nmap provides
options for controlling the verbosity of output as well as debugging
messages.  Output types may be sent to standard output or to named
files, which Nmap can append to or clobber.  Output files may also be
used to resume aborted scans.</para>

<para>Nmap makes output available in five different formats.
The default is called <literal>interactive output</literal>, and it is sent to standard
output (stdout).  There is also <literal>normal output</literal>,
which is similar to <literal>interactive</literal> except that it
displays less runtime information and warnings since it is expected to
be analyzed after the scan completes rather than interactively.</para>

<para>XML output is one of the most important output types, as it can
be converted to HTML, easily parsed by programs such as Nmap graphical
user interfaces, or imported into databases.</para>

<para>The two remaining output types are the simple <literal>grepable
output</literal> which includes most information for a target host on
a single line, and <literal>sCRiPt KiDDi3 0utPUt</literal> for users
who consider themselves |&lt;-r4d.</para>

<para>While interactive output is the default and has no associated
command-line options, the other four format options use the same
syntax.  They take one argument, which is the filename that results
should be stored in.  Multiple formats may be specified, but each
format may only be specified once.  For example, you may wish to save
normal output for your own review while saving XML of the same scan
for programmatic analysis.  You might do this with the options
<option>-oX myscan.xml -oN myscan.nmap</option>.  While this chapter
uses the simple names like <literal>myscan.xml</literal> for brevity,
more descriptive names are generally recommended.  The names chosen
are a matter of personal preference, though I use long ones that
incorporate the scan date and a word or two describing the scan, placed
in a directory named after the company I'm scanning.</para>

<para>While these options save results to files, Nmap still prints
interactive output to stdout as usual.  For example, the command
<command>nmap -oX myscan.xml target</command> prints XML to
<filename>myscan.xml</filename> and fills standard output with the same interactive results it would have printed if <option>-oX</option>
wasn't specified at all.  You can change this by passing a hyphen
character as the argument to one of the format types.  This causes
Nmap to deactivate interactive output, and instead print
results in the format you specified to the standard output stream.  So the
command <command>nmap -oX - target</command> will send only XML output to
stdout.  Serious errors may still be printed to the normal error
stream, stderr.</para>

<para>Unlike some Nmap arguments, the space between the logfile option
flag (such as <option>-oX</option>) and the filename or hyphen is
mandatory.  If you omit the flags and give arguments such as
<option>-oG-</option> or <option>-oXscan.xml</option>, a backwards
compatibility feature of Nmap will cause the creation of
<emphasis>normal format</emphasis> output files named
<filename>G-</filename> and <filename>Xscan.xml</filename>
respectively.</para>

<para>Nmap also offers options to control scan verbosity and to append
to output files rather than clobbering them.  All of these options are
described below.</para>

          <para>Requests that <literal>normal output</literal> be

        <listitem>


          <para>Requests that <literal>XML output</literal> be
          directed to the given filename.  Nmap includes a document
          type definition (DTD) which allows XML parsers to validate
          Nmap XML output.  While it is primarily intended for
          programmatic use, it can also help humans interpret Nmap XML
          output.  The DTD defines the legal elements of the format,
          and often enumerates the attributes and values they can take
          on.  The latest version is always available from <ulink
          url="http://insecure.org/nmap/data/nmap.dtd"/>.</para>

          <para>XML offers a stable format that is easily parsed by
          software. Free XML parsers are available for all major
          computer languages, including C/C++, Perl, Python, and
          Java. People have even written bindings for most of these
          languages to handle Nmap output and execution specifically.
          Examples are <ulink
          url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nmap-scanner/">Nmap::Scanner</ulink>
          and <ulink
          url="http://www.nmapparser.com">Nmap::Parser</ulink> in Perl
          CPAN.  In almost all cases that a non-trivial application
          interfaces with Nmap, XML is the preferred format.</para>

          <para>The XML output references an XSL stylesheet which can
          be used to format the results as HTML.  The easiest way to
          use this is simply to load the XML output in a web browser
          such as Firefox or IE.  By default, this will only work on
          the machine you ran Nmap on (or a similarly configured one)
          due to the hard-coded <filename>nmap.xsl</filename>
          filesystem path.  Use the <option>--webxml</option> or
          <option>--stylesheet</option> options to create portable XML
          files that render as HTML on any web-connected
          machine.</para>

<para>This output format is covered last because it is deprecated.
The XML output format is far more powerful, and is nearly as
convenient for experienced users.  XML is a standard for which dozens
of excellent parsers are available, while grepable output is my own
simple hack.  XML is extensible to support new Nmap features as they
are released, while I often must omit those features from grepable
output for lack of a place to put them.</para>

<para>Nevertheless, grepable output is still quite popular.  It is a
simple format that lists each host on one line and can be trivially
searched and parsed with standard Unix tools such as grep, awk, cut,
sed, diff, and Perl.  Even I usually use it for one-off tests done at the
command line.  Finding all the hosts with the SSH port open or that
are running Solaris takes only a simple grep to identify the hosts,
piped to an awk or cut command to print the desired fields.</para>

<para>Grepable output consists of comments (lines starting with a
pound (#)) and target lines.  A target line includes a combination
of 6 labeled fields, separated by tabs and followed with a colon.
The fields are <literal>Host</literal>, <literal>Ports</literal>,
<literal>Protocols</literal>, <literal>Ignored State</literal>,
<literal>OS</literal>, <literal>Seq Index</literal>,
<literal>IP ID</literal>, and <literal>Status</literal>.</para>

<para>The most important of these fields is generally
<literal>Ports</literal>, which gives details on each interesting
port.  It is a comma separated list of port entries.  Each port entry
represents one interesting port, and takes the form of seven slash
(/) separated subfields.  Those subfields are: <literal>Port
number</literal>, <literal>State</literal>, <literal>Protocol</literal>,
<literal>Owner</literal>, <literal>Service</literal>, <literal>SunRPC
info</literal>, and <literal>Version info</literal>.</para>

<para>As with XML output, this man page does not allow for documenting
the entire format.  A more detailed look at the Nmap grepable output
format is available from <ulink

           As with most programs, you can prefix the filenames with a

          <para>Increases the verbosity level, causing Nmap to
          print more information about the scan in progress. Open
          ports are shown as they are found and completion time
          estimates are provided when Nmap thinks a scan will take
          more than a few minutes. Use it twice for even greater
          verbosity. Using it more than twice has no effect.</para>

          <para>Most changes only affect interactive output, and some

          output types are meant to be processed by machines, so Nmap
          can give substantial detail by default in those formats
          without fatiguing a human user.  However, there are a few
          changes in other modes where output size can be reduced
          substantially by omitting some detail.  For example, a
          comment line in the grepable output that provides a list of
          all ports scanned is only printed in verbose mode because it
          can be quite long.</para>

<para>When even verbose mode doesn't provide sufficient data for you,
debugging is available to flood you with much more!  As with the
verbosity option (<option>-v</option>), debugging is enabled with a
command-line flag (<option>-d</option>) and the debug level can be
increased by specifying it multiple times.  Alternatively, you can set
a debug level by giving an argument to <option>-d</option>.  For
example, <option>-d9</option> sets level nine.  That is the highest
effective level and will produce thousands of lines unless you run a
very simple scan with very few ports and targets.</para>

<para>Debugging output is useful when a bug is suspected in Nmap,
or if you are simply confused as to what Nmap is doing and why.  As this
feature is mostly intended for developers, debug lines aren't always
self-explanatory.  You may get something like: <computeroutput>Timeout
vals: srtt: -1 rttvar: -1 to: 1000000 delta 14987 ==> srtt: 14987
rttvar: 14987 to: 100000</computeroutput>.  If you don't understand a line, your only recourses
are to ignore it, look it up in the source code, or request help from
the development list (nmap-dev).  Some lines are self explanatory, but
the messages become more obscure as the debug level is
increased.</para>

          also a valuable way for new users to understand exactly
          what Nmap is doing under the covers. To avoid printing
          thousands of lines, you may want to specify a limited
          number of ports to scan, such as <option>-p20-30</option>.  If you only care
          about the goings on of the version detection subsystem, use

normally done after the scan using tools such as
<application>grep</application>, <application>awk</application>, and
<application>Perl</application>, but this feature was added due to
overwhelming requests.  Specify <option>--open</option> to only see
<literal>open</literal>, <literal>open|filtered</literal>, and
<literal>unfiltered</literal> ports.  These three ports are treated just as they normally are, which means that <literal>open|filtered</literal> and <literal>unfiltered</literal> may be condensed into counts if there are an overwhelming number of them.

          <para>Warnings and errors printed by Nmap usually go only to

          to see those messages in the normal output file you
          specified, add this option. It is useful when you aren't
          watching the interactive output or are trying to debug a
          problem.  The messages will also still appear in interactive
          mode.  This will not work for most errors related to bad
          command-line arguments, as Nmap may not have initialized its
          output files yet.  In addition, some Nmap error/warning
          messages use a different system that does not yet support
          this option.  An alternative to using this option is
          redirecting interactive output (including the standard error
          stream) to a file.  While most Unix shells make that
          approach easy, it can be difficult on Windows.</para>

        <listitem>


          <para>Some extensive Nmap runs take a very long time&mdash;on
          the order of days.  Such scans don't always run to
          completion.  Restrictions may prevent Nmap from being run
          during working hours, the network could go down, the machine
          Nmap is running on might suffer a planned or unplanned
          reboot, or Nmap itself could crash.  The administrator running Nmap
          could cancel it for any other reason as well, by pressing
          <keycap>ctrl-C</keycap>.  Restarting the whole scan from the
          beginning may be undesirable.  Fortunately, if normal
          (<option>-oN</option>) or grepable (<option>-oG</option>)
          logs were kept, the user can ask Nmap to resume scanning
          with the target it was working on when execution ceased.
          Simply specify the <option>--resume</option> option and pass
          the normal/grepable output file as its argument.  No other
          arguments are permitted, as Nmap parses the output file to
          use the same ones specified previously.  Simply call Nmap as
          <command>nmap --resume
          <replaceable>logfilename</replaceable></command>.  Nmap will
          append new results to the data files specified in the

          <para>Nmap ships with an XSL stylesheet named

          directive which points to <filename>nmap.xml</filename>
          where it was initially installed by Nmap (or in the current
          working directory on Windows).  Simply load Nmap's XML
          output in a modern web browser and it should retrieve
          <filename>nmap.xsl</filename> from the filesystem and use it
          to render results.  If you wish to use a different
          stylesheet, specify it as the argument to
          <option>--stylesheet</option>.  You must pass the full
          pathname or URL.  One common invocation is
          <option>--stylesheet
          http://insecure.org/nmap/data/nmap.xsl</option>.  This

          does the same thing with less typing and memorization.
          Loading the XSL from Insecure.Org makes it easier to view results on

          <filename>nmap.xsl</filename>) installed.  So the URL is
          often more useful, but the local filesystem location of

        </term>
        <listitem>

          <para>Since 2002, Nmap has offered IPv6 support for its most
          popular features.  In particular, ping scanning (TCP-only),
          connect scanning, and version detection all support IPv6.
          The command syntax is the same as usual except that you also
          add the <option>-6</option> option.  Of course, you must use
          IPv6 syntax if you specify an address rather than a
          hostname.  An address might look like
          <literal>3ffe:7501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:14d0</literal>,
          so hostnames are recommended.  The output looks the same as
          usual, with the IPv6 address on the <quote>interesting
          ports</quote> line being the only IPv6 give away.</para>

          <para>While IPv6 hasn't exactly taken the world by storm, it
          gets significant use in some (usually Asian) countries and
          most modern operating systems support it.  To use Nmap
          with IPv6, both the source and target of your scan must be
          configured for IPv6.  If your ISP (like most of them) does
          not allocate IPv6 addresses to you, free tunnel brokers are
          widely available and work fine with Nmap.  One of the better
          ones is run by BT Exact at <ulink
          url="https://tb.ipv6.btexact.com/" />.  I have also used one
          that Hurricane Electric provides at <ulink
          url="http://ipv6tb.he.net/" />.  6to4 tunnels are another
          popular, free approach.</para>

          enables features, and not timing options (such as <option>-T4</option>) or

        </term>
        <listitem>


          <para>This option is the opposite of
          <option>--privileged</option>.  It tells Nmap to treat the
          user as lacking network raw socket and sniffing privileges.
          This is useful for testing, debugging, or when the raw
          network functionality of your operating system is somehow
          broken. The NMAP_UNPRIVILEGED environmental variable may be set as an
          equivalent alternative to
          <option>--unprivileged</option>.</para>

         </term>
         <listitem>

          <para>This option is only useful for memory-leak debugging.
          It causes Nmap to release allocated memory just before it
          quits so that actual memory leaks are easier to spot.
          Normally Nmap skips this as the OS does this anyway upon
          process termination.</para>

        <listitem>

          <para>Starts Nmap in interactive mode, which offers an
          interactive Nmap prompt allowing easy launching of
          multiple scans (either synchronously or in the
          background). This is useful for people who scan from
          multi-user systems as they often want to test their
          security without letting everyone else on the system know
          exactly which systems they are scanning. Use
          <option>--interactive</option> to activate this mode and then type <keycap>h</keycap> for
          help. This option is rarely used because proper shells
          are usually more familiar and feature-complete.  This option
          includes a bang (!) operator for executing shell commands,
          which is one of many reasons not to install Nmap setuid root.</para>

    <title>Examples</title>
    <para>Here are some Nmap usage examples, from the simple and
    routine to a little more complex and esoteric. Some actual
    IP addresses and domain names are used to make things
    more concrete. In their place you should substitute
    addresses/names from 
    <emphasis>your own network.</emphasis>.  While I don't think
    port scanning other networks is or should be illegal, some network
    administrators don't appreciate unsolicited scanning of their networks and may
    complain.  Getting permission first is the best approach.</para>

    <para>For testing purposes, you have permission to scan the host
    <literal>scanme.nmap.org</literal>.  This permission only includes
    scanning via Nmap and not testing exploits or denial of service
    attacks.  To conserve bandwidth, please do not initiate more than
    a dozen scans against that host per day.  If this free scanning
    target service is abused, it will be taken down and Nmap will
    report <computeroutput>Failed to resolve given hostname/IP:
    scanme.nmap.org</computeroutput>.  These permissions also apply to
    the hosts <literal>scanme2.nmap.org</literal>,
    <literal>scanme3.nmap.org</literal>, and so on, though those hosts
    do not currently exist.</para>

    <para>
      <command>nmap -v scanme.nmap.org</command>
    </para>
    <para>This option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine
    <literal>scanme.nmap.org</literal> . The <option>-v</option>
    option enables verbose mode.</para>
    <para>
      <command>nmap -sS -O scanme.nmap.org/24</command>
    </para>
    <para>Launches a stealth SYN scan against each machine that is
    up out of the 255 machines on <quote>class C</quote> network where
    Scanme resides. It also tries to determine what
    operating system is running on each host that is up and
    running. This requires root privileges because of the SYN scan
    and OS detection.</para>
    <para>
      <command>nmap -sV -p 22,53,110,143,4564
      198.116.0-255.1-127</command>
    </para>

    <para>Launches host enumeration and a TCP scan at the first half
    of each of the 255 possible 8 bit subnets in the 198.116 class B
    address space. This tests whether the systems run SSH, DNS, POP3,
    or IMAP on their standard ports, or anything on port 4564. For any
    of these ports found open, version detection is used to determine
    what application is running.</para>

    <para>
    <command>nmap -v -iR 100000 -P0 -p 80</command>
    </para>

    <para>Asks Nmap to choose 100,000 hosts at random and scan them
    for web servers (port 80).  Host enumeration is disabled with
    <option>-P0</option> since first sending a couple probes to
    determine whether a host is up is wasteful when you are only
    probing one port on each target host anyway.</para>

    <para>
      <command>nmap -P0 -p80 -oX logs/pb-port80scan.xml -oG
      logs/pb-port80scan.gnmap 216.163.128.20/20</command>
    </para>
    <para>This scans 4096 IPs for any webservers (without pinging
    them) and saves the output in grepable and XML formats.</para>

    <title>Bugs</title>

    <para>Like its author, Nmap isn't perfect.  But you can help make
    it better by sending bug reports or even writing patches.  If Nmap
    doesn't behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest
    version available from <ulink
    url="http://insecure.org/nmap/"/>.  If the problem persists,
    do some research to determine whether it has already been
    discovered and addressed.  Try Googling the error message or
    browsing the nmap-dev archives at <ulink
    url="http://seclists.org/" />.  Read this full munual page as
    well.  If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
    <email>nmap-dev@insecure.org</email>.  Please include everything
    you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of
    Nmap you are running and what operating system version it is
    running on.  Problem reports and Nmap usage questions sent to
    nmap-dev@insecure.org are far more likely to be answered than
    those sent to Fyodor directly.</para>

    <para>Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports.
    Basic instructions for creating patch files with your changes are
    available at <ulink
    url="http://insecure.org/nmap/data/HACKING" />.  Patches may
    be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.</para>
