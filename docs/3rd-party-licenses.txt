This file is a list of the licenses of the third-party software used by
Nmap and the other tools distributed with it. What follows is a
description of each third-party package. At the end of this file is the
license of each. The license of Nmap itself is in the COPYING file.

On all platforms, Nmap is normally linked with:
 o libpcap: Network packet capture library. Distributed with Nmap in the
   libpcap subdirectory.
   http://www.tcpdump.org/
 o libdnet: Networking library, used for low-level tasks such as sending
   ethernet frames. A modified version is distributed with Nmap in the
   libdnet-stripped subdirectory. A summary of Nmap-local modifications
   is in the file NMAP_MODIFICATIONS.
   http://code.google.com/p/libdnet/
 o PCRE: Perl-compatible regular expressions. PCRE is part of Nmap's
   version detection and is also made available as an NSE library.
   Distributed with Nmap in the libpcre subdirectory.
   http://www.pcre.org/
 o liblua: Lua programming language. Lua is the implementation language
   of NSE, the Nmap Scripting Engine. Nmap links with liblua to allow
   running Lua programs inside Nmap. Distributed with Nmap in the liblua
   subdirectory. liblua can be omitted by configuring with the
   --without-liblua configuration directive.
   http://www.lua.org/
 o OpenSSL: Cryptographic library. OpenSSL is used by service detection
   and by NSE to connect to SSL services. NSE also provides access to
   OpenSSL functions such as encryption and digest calculation. A binary
   copy of the OpenSSL library for Windows is distributed with Nmap in
   the subdirectory mswin32/OpenSSL. OpenSSL can be disabled by
   configuring with the --without-openssl configuration directive.
   http://www.openssl.org/

On Windows only, Nmap uses:
 o WinPcap: libpcap for Windows. The libpcap license applies to WinPcap,
   and it also has its own license. A binary copy of the library is
   distributed with Nmap in the subdirectory mswin32/winpcap.
   http://www.winpcap.org/

Certain Nmap Scripting Engine scripts use the simplified BSD license in
licenses/BSD-simplified.

Zenmap and Ndiff require:
 o Python. The binary distributions of Nmap include a Python interpreter
   and various libraries, built using either py2exe or py2app.
   http://www.python.org/

The Windows and Mac OS X binary packages include bundled versions of:
 o GLib, GTK+, ATK, Pango: These libraries are licensed under the GNU
   LGPL 2, a copy of which is in the file licenses/LGPL-2.
   http://www.gtk.org/
 o Cairo: graphics library. Dual-licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1 and the
   MPL 1.1. See the files licenses/LGPL-2.1 and licenses/MPL-1.1.
   http://www.cairographics.org/
 o libgailutil: Accessibility support for GTK+.
 o libpng, jpeg, LibTIFF: Image file format libraries used by GTK+.
   http://www.libpng.org/ http://www.ijg.org/ http://www.libtiff.org/
 o zlib and bzip2: compression libraries.
   http://www.zlib.org/ http://www.bzip.org/
 o Expat: XML parser library.
   http://expat.sourceforge.net/
 o fontconfig: font configuration library.
   http://www.fontconfig.org/
 o FreeType: font rendering library.
   http://www.freetype.org/
 o libiconv. Under the GNU LGPL 2.
   http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
 o libintl: gettext translation facilities. Under the GNU LGPL 2 and 2.1.
   http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
 o libxml2: XML parsing library.
   http://xmlsoft.org/
 o SQLite. 
   http://www.sqlite.org/
 o PyGTK, PyGObject: bindings for Python. Licensed under the GNU LGPL
   2.1.
   http://www.pygtk.org/
 o PyCairo: bindings for Python. Dual-licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1
   and the MPL 1.1.

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

License of Cairo

Cairo is free software.

Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be
redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public
License (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more
liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used
under either the LGPL or the MPL.

See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and
conditions of either license:

	COPYING-LGPL-2.1
	COPYING-MPL-1.1

Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing
information, (in the opening comment of each file).

[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src"
directory of the cairo source distribution. There are other components
of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test", "util", and "perf")
that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
directories contributes to a build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so
or cairo.dll or similar).

These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under
different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under
an MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes
in using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the COPYING
file under each directory and the opening comment of each file for copyright
and licensing information.

License of FreeType

The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  `GPL.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its
    advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

--- FTL.TXT ---

                    The FreeType Project LICENSE
                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc.
