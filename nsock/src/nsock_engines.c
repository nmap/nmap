 * nsock_engines.c -- This contains the functions and definitions to       *
 * manage the list of available IO engines.  Each IO engine leverages a    *
 * specific IO notification function to wait for events.  Nsock will try   *
 * to use the most efficient engine for your system.                       *
 *                                                                         *

 * Open Source, but this is important because the inability to relicense code
 * has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
