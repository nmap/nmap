 * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Nmap Software LLC grants permission

 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a right to

 *
 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and add

 * Open Source, but this is important because the inability to relicense code
 * has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
 * and NASM). We also occasionally relicense the code to third parties as
 * discussed above. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your
 * contributions, just say so when you send them.
