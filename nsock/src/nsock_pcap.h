 * There are three possible ways to read packets from pcap descriptor:

 *
 *  - select() + some hacks:
 *      this one is hack for older bsd systems,
 *      Descriptor *must* be set in nonblocking mode.
 *
 *   - never do select():
 *      this one is for WIN32 and other systems that return descriptor -1
 *      from pcap_get_selectable_fd().
 *      In this case descriptor *must* be set in nonblocking mode.
 *      If that fails than we can't do any sniffing from that box.

 * PCAP_CAN_DO_SELECT is not defined and therefore it has no effect on systems

/* Note that on most versions of most BSDs (including Mac OS X) select() and

 * FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), a simple select() or poll() will not return even after
 * a timeout specified in pcap_open_live() expires. To work around this, an
 * application that uses select() or poll() to wait for packets to arrive must
 * put the pcap_t in non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the select() or
 * poll() have a timeout less than or equal to the timeout specified in
 * pcap_open_live(), and must try to read packets after that timeout expires,
 * regardless of whether select() or poll() indicated that the file descriptor
 * for the pcap_t is ready to be read or not. (That workaround will not work in
 * FreeBSD 4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD 4.6 and later, select() and poll()
 * work correctly on BPF devices, so the workaround isn't necessary, although it
