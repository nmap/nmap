 *
 * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Nmap Software LLC grants permission
 * to link the code of this program with any version of the OpenSSL library
 * which is distributed under a license identical to that listed in the included
 * docs/licenses/OpenSSL.txt file, and distribute linked combinations including
 * the two. You must obey the GNU GPL in all respects for all of the code used

 *
 * If you received these files with a written license agreement stating terms

 *
 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a right to
 * know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. This also
 * allows you to audit the software for security holes.
 *
 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and add
 * new features. You are highly encouraged to send your changes to the
 * dev@nmap.org mailing list for possible incorporation into the main
 * distribution. By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the Insecure.Org
 * development mailing lists, or checking them into the Nmap source code
 * repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) that you are
 * offering the Nmap Project (Nmap Software LLC) the unlimited, non-exclusive
 * right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code. Nmap will always be available
 * Open Source, but this is important because the inability to relicense code
 * has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
 * and NASM). We also occasionally relicense the code to third parties as
 * discussed above. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your
 * contributions, just say so when you send them.
