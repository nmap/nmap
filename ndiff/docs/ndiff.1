Ndiff, like the standard

.SH "OPTIONS SUMMARY"

\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show a help message and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Include all hosts and ports in the output, not only those that have changed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-text\fR
.RS 4
Write output in human\-readable text format\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\fR
.RS 4
Write output in machine\-readable XML format\&. The document structure is defined in the file
ndiff\&.dtd
included in the distribution\&.
.RE
.PP
Any other arguments are taken to be the names of Nmap XML output files\&. There must be exactly two\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Let\*(Aqs use Ndiff to compare the output of two Nmap scans that use different options\&. In the first, we\*(Aqll do a fast scan (\fB\-F\fR), which scans fewer ports for speed\&. In the second, we\*(Aqll scan the larger default set of ports, and run an NSE script\&.

.PP
Changes are marked by a
\-
or
+
at the beginning of a line\&. We can see from the output that the scan without the
\fB\-F\fR
fast scan option found two additional ports: 70 and 31337\&. The
html\-title
script produced some additional output for port 80\&. From the port counts, we may infer that the fast scan scanned 100 ports (95 filtered, 3 open, and 2 closed), while the normal scan scanned 1000 (993 filtered, 3 open, and 4 closed)\&.
.PP
The
\fB\-v\fR
(or
\fB\-\-verbose\fR) option to Ndiff made it show even the ports that didn\*(Aqt change, like 22 and 25\&. Without
\fB\-v\fR, they would not have been shown\&.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.PP
There are two output modes: text and XML\&. Text output is the default, and can also be selected with the
\fB\-\-text\fR
option\&. Text output resembles a unified diff of Nmap\*(Aqs normal terminal output\&. Each line is preceded by a character indicating whether and how it changed\&.
\-
means that the line was in the first scan but not in the second;
+
means it was in the second but not the first\&. A line that changed is represented by a
\-
line followed by a
+
line\&. Lines that did not change are preceded by a blank space\&.
.PP
Example\ \&1
is an example of text output\&. Here, port 80 on the host photos\-cache\-snc1\&.facebook\&.com gained a service version (lighttpd 1\&.5\&.0)\&. The host at 69\&.63\&.179\&.25 changed its reverse DNS name\&. The host at 69\&.63\&.184\&.145 was completely absent in the first scan but came up in the second\&.

XML output, intended to be processed by other programs, is selected with the
\fB\-\-xml\fR
option\&. It is based on Nmap\*(Aqs XML output, with a few additional elements to indicate differences\&. The XML document is enclosed in
\fInmapdiff\fR
and
\fIscandiff\fR
elements\&. Host differences are enclosed in
\fIhostdiff\fR
tags and port differences are enclosed in
\fIportdiff\fR
tags\&. Inside a
\fIhostdiff\fR
or
\fIportdiff\fR,
\fIa\fR
and
\fIb\fR
tags show the state of the host or port in the first scan (\fIa\fR) or the second scan (\fIb\fR)\&.
.PP
Example\ \&2
shows the XML diff of the same scans shown above in
Example\ \&1\&. Notice how port 80 of photos\-cache\-snc1\&.facebook\&.com is enclosed in
\fIportdiff\fR
tags\&. For 69\&.63\&.179\&.25, the old hostname is in
\fIa\fR
tags and the new is in
\fIb\fR\&. For the new host 69\&.63\&.184\&.145, there is a
\fIb\fR
in the
\fIhostdiff\fR
without a corresponding
\fIa\fR, indicating that there was no information for the host in the first scan\&.

Ndiff started as a project by Michael Pattrick during the 2008 Google Summer of Code\&. Michael designed the program and led the discussion of its output formats\&. He wrote versions of the program in Perl and C++, but the summer ended shortly after it was decided to rewrite the program in Python for the sake of Windows (and Zenmap) compatibility\&. This Python version was written by David Fifield\&. James Levine
\m[blue]\fBreleased\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
a Perl script named Ndiff with similar functionality in 2000\&.
