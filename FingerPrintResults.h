 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software

 * add new features. You are highly encouraged to submit your changes as a

 * submissions as described in the Nmap Public Source License Contributor
 * Agreement. This is important because we fund the project by selling licenses
 * with various terms, and also because the inability to relicense code has
 * caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
