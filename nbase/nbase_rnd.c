/* This function is magic ;-)
 *
 * Sometimes Nmap wants to generate IPs that look random

 * can't be used for this purpose because it can generate duplicates
 * if you get enough IPs (birthday paradox).
 *
 * This routine exploits the fact that a LCG won't repeat for the
 * entire duration of its period.  An LCG has some pretty bad
 * properties though so this routine does extra work to try to
 * tweak the LCG output so that is has very good statistics but
 * doesn't repeat.  The tweak used was mostly made up on the spot
 * but is generally based on good ideas and has been moderately
 * tested.  See links and reasoning below.

  /* What is this math crap?
   *
   * The whole idea behind this generator is that an LCG can be constructed
   * with a period of exactly 2^32.  As long as the LCG is fed back onto
   * itself the period will be 2^32.  The tweak after the LCG is just
   * a good permutation in GF(2^32).
   *
   * To accomplish the tweak the notion of rounds and round keys from
   * block ciphers has been borrowed.  The only special aspect of this
   * block cipher is that the first round short-circuits the LCG.
   *
   * This block cipher uses three rounds.  Each round is as follows:
   *
   * 1) Affine transform in GF(2^32)
   * 2) Rotate left by round constant
   * 3) XOR with round key
   *
   * For round one the affine transform is used as an LCG.
   */

  /* Reasoning:
   *
   * Affine transforms were chosen both to make a LCG and also
   * to try to introduce non-linearity.
   *
   * The rotate up each round was borrowed from SHA-1 and was introduced
   * to help obscure the obvious short cycles when you truncate an LCG with
   * a power-of-two period like the one used.
   *
   * The XOR with the round key was borrowed from several different
   * published functions (but see Xorshift)
   * and provides a different sequence for the full LCG.
   * There are 3 32 bit round keys.  This generator can
   * generate 2^96 different sequences of period 2^32.
   *
   * This generator was tested with Dieharder.  It did not fail any test.
