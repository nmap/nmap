/* Winsock defines its own error codes that are analogous to but
   different from those in <errno.h>. The error macros have similar
   names, for example
     EINTR -> WSAEINTR
     ECONNREFUSED -> WSAECONNREFUSED
   But the values are different. The errno codes are small integers,
   while the Winsock codes start at 10000 or so.
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms737828

   Later in this file there is a block of code that defines the errno
   names to their Winsock equivalents, so that you can write code using
   the errno names only, and have it still work on Windows. However this
   causes some problems that are worked around in the following few
   lines. First, we prohibit the inclusion of <errno.h>, so that the
   only error codes visible are those we explicitly define in this file.
   This will cause a compilation error if someone uses a code we're not
   yet aware of instead of using an incompatible value at runtime.
   Second, because <errno.h> is not defined, the C++0x header
   <system_error> doesn't compile, so we pretend not to have C++0x to
   avoid it. */
