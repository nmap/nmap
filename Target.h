 *
 * If you have received a written Nmap license agreement or contract

 *
 * The official Nmap Windows builds include the Npcap software
 * (https://npcap.com) for packet capture and transmission. It is under

 *
 * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a
 * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.
 * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.
 *
 * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs, and
 * add new features. You are highly encouraged to submit your changes as a

 * submissions as described in the Nmap Public Source License Contributor
 * Agreement. This is important because we fund the project by selling licenses
 * with various terms, and also because the inability to relicense code has
 * caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE
 * and NASM).
