/** Computes and returns the Internet checksum.
 * @warning  This method requires the object to be linked to either an IPv6Header
 * object or an IPv4Header one, so the caller must ensure that objects are
 * properly linked with calls to setNextElement() like this:
 *
 * IPv6Header ip6;
 * TCPHeader tcp;
 * [...] # Set header fields
 * ip6.setNextElement(&tcp);
 * tcp.setSum();
 *
 * Note that there can be a number of other headers (like IPv6 extension headers)
 * between the transport header and the network one, but all of them need to
 * be linked in order for this method to traverse the list of headers and find
 * the IP source and destination address, required to compute the checksum. So
 * things like the following are OK:
 *
 * IPv6Header ip6;
 * HopByHopHeader hop;
 * RoutingHeader rte;
 * FragmentHeader frg;
 * UDPHeader udp;
 * [...] # Set whatever header fields you need
 * ip6.setNextElement(&hop);
 * hop.setNextElement(&rte);
 * rte.setNextElement(&frg);
 * frg.setNextElement(&udp);
 * udp.setSum(); # setSum() will be able to reach the IPv6Header. */
